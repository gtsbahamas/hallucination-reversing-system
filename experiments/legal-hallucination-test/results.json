    "response": "# LEGAL MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** [Attorney]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Analysis of Potential Retaliatory Discharge Claim for Termination Following Workers' Compensation Claim Filing – Texas Law\n\n---\n\n## I. ISSUE PRESENTED\n\nWhether an employer's termination of an employee following the filing of a workers' compensation claim constitutes actionable retaliatory discharge under federal and/or Texas state law.\n\n---\n\n## II. BRIEF ANSWER\n\nUnder Texas law, an employer's termination of an employee in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim constitutes unlawful retaliatory discharge and provides grounds for a civil action. Texas Labor Code § 451.001 creates a statutory cause of action for such retaliation. However, no general federal cause of action exists for workers' compensation retaliation absent additional circumstances (such as FMLA violations or disability discrimination). The employee likely has a viable claim under Texas law if causation and other elements can be established.\n\n---\n\n## III. APPLICABLE FACTS\n\n[To be supplemented with specific facts, including:]\n- Employee's work history and position\n- Date and circumstances of workers' compensation claim filing\n- Date and stated reason for termination\n- Temporal proximity between claim filing and termination\n- Any statements by management regarding the claim\n- Employee's work performance history\n- Whether similarly situated employees were treated differently\n\n---\n\n## IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n### A. Federal Law – Limited Protection\n\n#### 1. No General Federal Cause of Action\n\nThere is no comprehensive federal statute prohibiting retaliation for filing workers' compensation claims. Workers' compensation is primarily governed by state law, and retaliation protections similarly derive from state statutes and common law.\n\n#### 2. Potential Federal Claims in Limited Circumstances\n\n**Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nIf the employee's workplace injury also qualified for FMLA leave (serious health condition), termination for taking or requesting such leave may violate 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). See *Nero v. Indus. Molding Corp.*, 167 F.3d 921, 929 (5th Cir. 1999) (recognizing FMLA retaliation claims). However, FMLA only applies to:\n- Employers with 50+ employees\n- Employees who worked 1,250+ hours in preceding 12 months\n- Employees at worksites with 50+ employees within 75 miles\n\n**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**\n\nIf the work-related injury constitutes a \"disability\" under the ADA (substantially limits a major life activity), termination based on the disability could violate 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). See *Zenor v. El Paso Healthcare Sys., Ltd.*, 176 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir. 1999). This requires showing the employer regarded the employee as disabled or that an actual disability exists.\n\n**Conclusion on Federal Law:** Absent FMLA or ADA applicability, federal law provides no direct remedy for workers' compensation retaliation.\n\n---\n\n### B. Texas State Law – Primary Source of Protection\n\n#### 1. Statutory Prohibition – Texas Labor Code § 451.001\n\nTexas Labor Code § 451.001 provides the primary statutory protection against workers' compensation retaliation:\n\n> \"A person may not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee because the employee has in good faith filed a workers' compensation claim or hired a lawyer to represent the employee in a claim.\"\n\n**TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 451.001** (West 2023).\n\nThis statute creates an **exception to Texas's employment-at-will doctrine** and provides an independent cause of action. *Continental Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez*, 937 S.W.2d 444, 451 (Tex. 1996).\n\n#### 2. Elements of a Section 451.001 Claim\n\nTo establish a prima facie case under § 451.001, the employee must prove:\n\n1. The employee filed a workers' compensation claim or hired an attorney to represent them in a claim;\n2. The employer took adverse employment action against the employee;\n3. The employer's action was causally connected to the filing of the claim or hiring of counsel; and\n4. The claim was filed in good faith.\n\n*Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. v. McCardell*, 369 S.W.3d 367, 378-79 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.); *Montgomery Co. Hosp. Dist. v. Brown*, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex. 1998).\n\n#### 3. Analysis of Each Element\n\n**Element 1: Filing of Workers' Compensation Claim**\n\nThis element is typically straightforward and requires documentation showing the employee filed a claim with the employer's workers' compensation carrier or the Texas Department of Insurance, Division of Workers' Compensation (DWC).\n\nThe statute also protects employees who hire lawyers to represent them in claims, even before formal filing. *See* TEX. LAB. CODE § 451.001.\n\n**Element 2: Adverse Employment Action**\n\nTermination clearly constitutes an adverse employment action. The statute's prohibition extends beyond discharge to include \"any other manner\" of discrimination, encompassing demotion, reduction in pay, unfavorable reassignment, or other materially adverse actions. *Continental Coffee*, 937 S.W.2d at 451.\n\n**Element 3: Causal Connection**\n\nCausation is often the most contested element. The employee must demonstrate that the filing of the workers' compensation claim was a \"but-for\" cause of the termination. *University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar*, 570 U.S. 338 (2013) (applying but-for causation standard to retaliation claims).\n\nTexas courts consider several factors in determining causation:\n\n**(a) Temporal Proximity**\n\nClose timing between the claim filing and termination creates an inference of retaliation. Courts have found sufficient temporal proximity when termination occurs:\n- Within days: Strong inference of causation. *See Specialty Retailers, Inc. v. DeMoranville*, 933 S.W.2d 490, 492-93 (Tex. 1996) (three days).\n- Within weeks or months: May support inference depending on other factors. *See Montgomery Co. Hosp. Dist.*, 965 S.W.2d at 503 (two months sufficient when combined with other evidence).\n- Extended periods: Weakens inference absent other supporting evidence. *See Continental Coffee*, 937 S.W.2d at 452 (13 months insufficient without additional evidence).\n\n**(b) Employer Knowledge**\n\nThe employee must show the decision-maker knew about the workers' compensation claim. *See McCardell*, 369 S.W.3d at 380. Knowledge can be actual or imputed through the organization.\n\n**(c) Pretextual Reasons**\n\nEvidence that the employer's stated reason for termination is pretextual supports causation. Factors include:\n- Shifting explanations for termination\n- Deviation from established policies or procedures\n- Inconsistent application of discipline\n- Positive performance reviews prior to claim filing\n- Lack of documentation supporting stated reason\n\n*See City of Keller v. Wilson*, 168 S.W.3d 802, 816-17 (Tex. 2005).\n\n**(d) Direct Evidence**\n\nStatements by supervisors or decision-makers linking the termination to the workers' compensation claim provide strong evidence of causation. *See Specialty Retailers*, 933 S.W.2d at 493 (statement that employee was terminated because \"she was hurt\" constituted direct evidence).\n\n**(e) Statistical or Comparative Evidence**\n\nEvidence showing disparate treatment of employees who filed workers' compensation claims versus those who did not can support a causation finding.\n\n**Element 4: Good Faith**\n\nThe statute protects only claims filed \"in good faith.\" This requirement prevents protection for fraudulent or knowingly false claims. The good faith requirement is construed liberally in favor of employees. *Continental Coffee*, 937 S.W.2d at 451.\n\nAn employee acts in good faith when they reasonably believe they suffered a work-related injury, even if the claim is ultimately denied or unsuccessful. *Mission Petroleum Carriers, Inc. v. Solomon*, 106 S.W.3d 705, 709 (Tex. 2003).\n\nBad faith requires showing the employee knowingly filed a false claim or fabricated the injury. *McCardell*, 369 S.W.3d at 381.\n\n#### 4. Employer Defenses\n\n**Legitimate Business Reason**\n\nAn employer may defeat a retaliation claim by proving it would have taken the same action regardless of the workers' compensation claim filing. The employer must show a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason existed for the termination. *Continental Coffee*, 937 S.W.2d at 452.\n\nCommon defenses include:\n- Poor work performance (must be documented)\n- Violation of company policy\n- Reduction in force or position elimination\n- Attendance problems unrelated to the injury\n\nThe credibility of these defenses depends on:\n- Documentation predating the claim\n- Consistent application to other employees\n- Adherence to progressive discipline policies\n- Absence of similarly situated employees who were treated more favorably\n\n**After-Acquired Evidence**\n\nEvidence of employee misconduct discovered after termination may limit remedies but generally does not eliminate liability for retaliatory discharge. *McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co.*, 513 U.S. 352, 362-63 (1995).\n\n#### 5. Burden of Proof and Standards\n\nTexas courts apply a **burden-shifting framework** similar to *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792 (1973):\n\n**Step 1:** Employee establishes prima facie case (as outlined above)\n\n**Step 2:** Burden shifts to employer to articulate legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for termination\n\n**Step 3:** Burden shifts back to employee to prove employer's reason is pretextual and retaliatory motive was determinative\n\n*See City of Keller*, 168 S.W.3d at 813-14.\n\nThe ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the employee throughout. *Id.*\n\n#### 6. Damages and Remedies Under § 451.001\n\nIf the employee prevails, available remedies include:\n\n**(a) Economic Damages**\n- Lost wages and benefits (past and future)\n- Lost earning capacity\n- Medical expenses related to emotional distress or other harms\n*See* TEX. LAB. CODE § 451.001.\n\n**(b) Compensatory Damages**\nDamages for mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of reputation, and other non-economic harms are recoverable. The employee need not present expert testimony for emotional distress damages. *Parkway Co. v. Woodruff*, 901 S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995).\n\n**(c) Punitive Damages**\nTexas law allows punitive damages upon showing:\n- Actual damages were awarded\n- Harm resulted from fraud, malice, or gross negligence\n*See* TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 41.003.\n\nPunitive damages are capped at the greater of:\n- $200,000; or\n- Two times economic damages plus non-economic damages up to $750,000\n*See* TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 41.008.\n\n**(d) Attorneys' Fees**\nRecovery of reasonable attorneys' fees is authorized under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 38.001 for breach of contract claims, but § 451.001 does not explicitly provide for fee-shifting. However, some courts have awarded fees under theories of common law indemnity or as part of compensatory damages. *See generally Venture Encoding Serv., Inc. v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co.*, 107 S.W.3d 729 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.).\n\n**(e) Reinstatement**\nEquitable relief, including reinstatement, may be available though courts have discretion in fashioning equitable remedies.\n\n#### 7. Statute of Limitations\n\nThe statute of limitations for claims under § 451.001 is **two years** from the date of termination. *TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 16.003(a)** (general personal injury limitations period applies).\n\n**Discovery Rule:** In limited circumstances, the limitations period may be tolled if the employee did not discover and could not reasonably have discovered the retaliatory nature of the termination. However, this doctrine applies rarely because termination is usually an overt act. *See KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp.*, 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex. 1999).\n\n---\n\n### C. Common Law Retaliatory Discharge (Limited Applicability)\n\nPrior to the enactment of § 451.001, some Texas courts recognized a narrow common law exception to at-will employment for retaliatory discharge. *Sabine Pilot Serv., Inc. v. Hauck*, 687 S.W.2d 733 (Tex. 1985).\n\nHowever, the Texas Supreme Court has held that **§ 451.001 preempts common law retaliatory discharge claims** related to workers' compensation. *Continental Coffee*, 937 S.W.2d at 451. Therefore, the statutory remedy is the exclusive avenue for relief in this context.\n\n---\n\n### D. Other Potential Texas Law Claims\n\n#### 1. Disability Discrimination – Texas Labor Code Chapter 21\n\nThe Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA) prohibits discrimination based on disability. *TEX. LAB. CODE §§ 21.001-.556*.\n\nIf the work-related injury constitutes a disability (substantially limits a major life activity), termination based on that disability may violate Chapter 21. The analysis parallels ADA claims.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Employer must have 15+ employees\n- Employee must have filed charge with EEOC/TCHR within 180/300 days\n- Similar elements to federal ADA claims\n\n#### 2. Violation of Public Policy\n\nWhile § 451.001 preempts common law claims for workers' compensation retaliation specifically, violations of other clear public policies may support independent tort claims. However, Texas recognizes very limited public policy exceptions to at-will employment. *See Sabine Pilot*, 687 S.W.2d at 735 (limiting exception to sole public policy articulated by statute or regulation).\n\n---\n\n## V. EVIDENTIARY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nTo strengthen a § 451.001 claim, counsel should gather:\n\n### A. Documentary Evidence\n- Workers' compensation claim form and filing date\n- Documentation of employer's knowledge (emails, reports, claim notices)\n- Termination letter or documentation\n- Employee personnel file, including performance reviews\n- Disciplinary records (employee and comparators)\n- Company policies and procedures\n- Attendance records\n- Medical records establishing work-related injury\n- Communications between employee and supervisors regarding injury/claim\n\n### B. Testimonial Evidence\n- Employee testimony regarding circumstances of injury and termination\n- Witness testimony regarding:\n  - Statements by supervisors about claim\n  - Employer's knowledge of claim\n  - Treatment of other employees\n  - Employee's work performance\n- Expert testimony (if needed on damages, particularly future lost earnings)\n\n### C. Timeline\nCreate detailed chronology showing:\n- Date of injury\n- Date claim filed\n- Date employer learned of claim\n- Date of termination or adverse action\n- Any intervening events or disciplinary actions\n\n---\n\n## VI. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### A. Pre-Litigation\n- **Demand Letter:** Consider sending demand letter outlining claim and requesting settlement\n- **EEOC Charge:** If disability discrimination claim exists, file with EEOC (required before filing suit)\n- **Documentation:** Secure all evidence before filing suit, as employer may claim privilege or work product after litigation commences\n\n### B. Litigation Considerations\n- **Venue:** File in district court in county where employee worked or where employer has principal office\n- **Jury Appeal:** Workers' compensation retaliation claims often have strong jury appeal\n- **Settlement Posture:** Employers often prefer settlement to avoid publicity and potential punitive damages\n- **Discovery:** Focus on:\n  - Decision-maker depositions\n  - Treatment of similarly situated employees\n  - Company communications about employee\n  - Financial condition (for punitive damages)\n\n---\n\n## VII.

    "response": "# LEGAL MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** Associate Attorney\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Enforceability of Non-Compete Agreements in California\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE\n\nWhether non-compete agreements are enforceable under California law, including the applicable statutory framework, relevant case law, and recent legislative developments.\n\n---\n\n## BRIEF ANSWER\n\nNon-compete agreements are generally **void and unenforceable** in California under Business and Professions Code § 16600, subject to only narrow statutory exceptions. California maintains one of the strongest public policies against restraints on trade in employment relationships. Recent legislation (SB 699, effective January 1, 2024) has further strengthened these protections and expanded remedies for employees.\n\n---\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\n### I. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n\n#### A. Business and Professions Code § 16600\n\nThe primary statute governing non-compete agreements is California Business and Professions Code § 16600, which states:\n\n> \"Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.\"\n\nThis statute embodies California's strong public policy favoring open competition and employee mobility. *Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP*, 44 Cal. 4th 937, 946 (2008).\n\n#### B. Narrow Statutory Exceptions\n\nCalifornia law provides only three specific exceptions to § 16600:\n\n1. **§ 16601** – Sale of goodwill of a business or sale of all ownership interest in the business\n2. **§ 16602** – Dissolution or dissociation of a partnership\n3. **§ 16602.5** – Dissolution or dissociation of a limited liability company\n\nThese exceptions are narrowly construed and apply only to owners with significant ownership interests who sell their stakes in the business. *Edwards*, 44 Cal. 4th at 946-47.\n\n### II. KEY CASE LAW\n\n#### A. *Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP*, 44 Cal. 4th 937 (2008)\n\nThis landmark California Supreme Court decision established critical principles:\n\n**Facts:** Arthur Andersen required Edwards, a certified public accountant, to sign an agreement not to provide accounting services to any former client for one year after leaving the firm.\n\n**Holding:** The California Supreme Court held that § 16600 applies to all employment non-compete agreements, not just those that are unreasonable in scope. The court rejected the \"narrow restraint\" exception that some lower courts had applied.\n\n**Key Holdings:**\n- Section 16600 means what it says: every non-compete agreement is void unless it falls within a statutory exception\n- The reasonableness of the restraint is irrelevant\n- California will not apply the \"rule of reason\" analysis used in other jurisdictions\n- The statute reflects California's strong public policy interest in employee mobility and open competition\n\nThe court stated: \"The law protects Californians and ensures 'that every citizen shall retain the right to pursue any lawful employment and enterprise of their choice.'\" *Id.* at 946 (citation omitted).\n\n#### B. *AMN Healthcare, Inc. v. Aya Healthcare Services, Inc.*, 28 Cal. App. 5th 923 (2018)\n\n**Facts:** AMN Healthcare sought to enforce employee non-solicitation provisions preventing former employees from recruiting AMN's current employees.\n\n**Holding:** The Court of Appeal held that employee non-solicitation agreements are generally unenforceable under § 16600 because they restrain former employees from pursuing their occupation.\n\n**Significance:** This decision extended *Edwards* to employee non-solicitation provisions, finding they indirectly restrain trade by limiting how former employees can conduct business.\n\n#### C. *Golden v. California Emergency Physicians Medical Group*, 782 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 2015)\n\n**Facts:** Emergency room physicians challenged one-year non-compete provisions restricting them from working at nearby hospitals.\n\n**Holding:** The Ninth Circuit, applying California law, held the non-compete provisions void under § 16600, rejecting arguments that narrowly tailored restrictions should be enforceable.\n\n**Key Principle:** Even geographically and temporally limited non-competes are unenforceable in California, regardless of whether they might be considered \"reasonable\" in other jurisdictions.\n\n#### D. *Fillpoint LLC v. Maas*, 206 Cal. App. 4th 1170 (2012)\n\n**Facts:** Non-compete agreement incident to the sale of a business.\n\n**Holding:** The court clarified that the § 16601 exception for sale of business applies only when:\n1. The seller has a substantial ownership interest in the business\n2. The covenant is necessary to protect the goodwill being purchased\n3. The restraint is reasonable in scope\n\n**Significance:** Even statutory exceptions are narrowly construed and cannot be used to circumvent § 16600's general prohibition.\n\n### III. ENFORCEABLE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS\n\nWhile non-competes are generally void, California courts recognize certain limited restrictions:\n\n#### A. Trade Secret Protection\n\nEmployers may protect legitimate trade secrets under the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), Civil Code §§ 3426-3426.11, and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), 18 U.S.C. § 1836 et seq.\n\n*SunPower Corp. v. SolarCity Corp.*, 2014 WL 4277194 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2014) (employee can be enjoined from disclosing trade secrets but not from working for competitor).\n\n#### B. Customer Non-Solicitation Provisions\n\nCustomer non-solicitation provisions may be enforceable if narrowly tailored to protect trade secrets, but courts scrutinize these closely.\n\n*Dowell v. Biosense Webster, Inc.*, 179 Cal. App. 4th 564 (2009) (customer non-solicitation clause unenforceable where it restricted employee's ability to work in the industry).\n\nContrast: *Loral Corp. v. Moyes*, 174 Cal. App. 3d 268 (1985) (customer non-solicitation enforceable where limited to protecting confidential information).\n\n#### C. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements\n\nProperly drafted confidentiality agreements protecting trade secrets and confidential proprietary information remain enforceable.\n\n*Retirement Group v. Galante*, 176 Cal. App. 4th 1226 (2009).\n\n#### D. Non-Solicitation of Employees (Limited Circumstances)\n\nEmployee non-solicitation may be enforceable when:\n1. Limited to protecting trade secrets embodied in customer relationships\n2. Narrowly tailored in scope and duration\n3. Does not substantially restrain the former employee's ability to work\n\nHowever, post-*AMN Healthcare*, these provisions face heightened scrutiny.\n\n### IV. CHOICE OF LAW CONSIDERATIONS\n\n#### A. *Application Group, Inc. v. Hunter Group, Inc.*, 61 Cal. App. 4th 881 (1998)\n\n**Holding:** California courts will apply § 16600 even when a contract contains a choice-of-law provision selecting another state's law, if:\n1. The employee is a California resident, or\n2. The employment relationship is primarily in California\n\n**Rationale:** Section 16600 embodies a fundamental California public policy that cannot be waived by contract.\n\n#### B. *Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Exxon Insurance Co.*, 45 Cal. App. 5th 284 (2020)\n\n**Holding:** California's strong public policy against non-competes applies extraterritorially to protect California employees even when other states' laws are invoked.\n\n### V. RECENT LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS\n\n#### A. Senate Bill 699 (Effective January 1, 2024)\n\nCalifornia enacted SB 699, which significantly strengthened employee protections:\n\n**Key Provisions:**\n\n1. **New § 16600.1** – Expressly voids non-compete agreements even if:\n   - Entered into outside California\n   - Governed by another state's law\n   - The employee now works in California\n\n2. **Employer Notice Requirement** – Employers must notify current and former employees (dating back to January 1, 2022) that any non-compete agreements they signed are void\n\n3. **Private Right of Action** – Employees may sue employers who attempt to enforce void non-compete agreements\n\n4. **Statutory Damages** – Employees may recover injunctive relief and other remedies\n\n**Impact:** This legislation closes potential loopholes and provides stronger enforcement mechanisms for employees.\n\n#### B. Assembly Bill 1076 (2020)\n\nAdded Business and Professions Code § 16600.5, which:\n- Prohibits employers from entering into non-compete agreements with employees who are laid off or terminated without cause\n- Clarifies that § 16600 applies broadly regardless of termination circumstances\n\n### VI. EXCEPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS\n\n#### A. Sale of Business Exception (§ 16601)\n\nRequirements for enforceability:\n1. Seller must have substantial ownership interest (case law suggests at least 25%)\n2. Must involve sale of goodwill or all ownership shares\n3. Restraint must be reasonably necessary to protect purchased goodwill\n4. Geographic and temporal scope must be reasonable\n\n*Monogram Industries, Inc. v. SAR Industries, Inc.*, 64 Cal. App. 3d 692 (1976).\n\n#### B. Partnership Dissolution (§ 16602) and LLC Dissociation (§ 16602.5)\n\nThese exceptions apply only to:\n- Actual partners or LLC members (not employees)\n- In connection with dissolution or dissociation\n- With reasonable restrictions\n\n*Howard v. Babcock*, 6 Cal. 4th 409 (1993).\n\n### VII. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR EMPLOYERS\n\n#### A. Alternative Protective Measures\n\nSince non-competes are unenforceable, California employers should focus on:\n\n1. **Robust confidentiality agreements** protecting trade secrets\n2. **Invention assignment agreements** (Labor Code § 2870)\n3. **Non-solicitation of customers** (narrowly drafted to protect trade secrets)\n4. **Garden leave provisions** with continued compensation\n5. **Trade secret protection protocols** and documentation\n6. **Forfeiture-for-competition clauses** in equity and bonus plans (limited enforceability)\n\n#### B. Compliance with SB 699\n\nEmployers must:\n1. Review all employment agreements for non-compete provisions\n2. Send required notices to current and former employees\n3. Cease enforcement efforts of existing non-compete agreements\n4. Update form agreements to remove non-compete provisions\n5. Consider alternative protective measures\n\n### VIII. NATIONAL CONTEXT\n\n#### A. Federal Trade Commission Proposed Rule\n\nIn January 2023, the FTC proposed a rule that would ban non-compete clauses nationwide. While not yet finalized, this reflects a national trend toward California's approach.\n\nCalifornia's framework provides insight into how broader non-compete bans might function.\n\n#### B. California as Outlier\n\nCalifornia remains one of the most employee-friendly jurisdictions regarding non-competes. Most states enforce \"reasonable\" non-competes under a rule of reason analysis.\n\nStates with similar prohibitions:\n- North Dakota (N.D. Cent. Code § 9-08-06)\n- Oklahoma (Okla. Stat. tit. 15, § 217-219A)\n\nHowever, California's prohibition is the most comprehensive and strictly enforced.\n\n### IX. ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES\n\n#### A. Employee Remedies\n\nEmployees faced with non-compete agreements may:\n\n1. **Declaratory relief** – Seek judicial declaration that agreement is void\n2. **Affirmative claims** – Under SB 699, sue for attempted enforcement\n3. **Attorney's fees** – May be available under unfair competition laws\n4. **Damages** – For lost wages and opportunities if enforcement was attempted\n\n*Edwards*, 44 Cal. 4th at 949.\n\n#### B. Employer Remedies (Limited)\n\nEmployers' options are restricted to:\n\n1. **Trade secret misappropriation claims** under CUTSA or DTSA\n2. **Breach of fiduciary duty** (for high-level employees during employment)\n3. **Unfair competition** (Business and Professions Code § 17200) for misuse of confidential information\n4. **Inevitable disclosure doctrine** – Generally rejected in California\n\n*Whyte v. Schlage Lock Co.*, 101 Cal. App. 4th 1443 (2002) (rejecting inevitable disclosure doctrine).\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nCalifornia maintains the nation's strongest prohibition against employment non-compete agreements. Business and Professions Code § 16600 renders such agreements void except in narrow circumstances involving business sales or entity dissolution. The California Supreme Court's decision in *Edwards* eliminated any \"reasonableness\" exception, and recent legislation (SB 699) has further strengthened employee protections.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. Non-compete agreements are presumptively **void and unenforceable**\n2. Statutory exceptions are **narrow** and strictly construed\n3.

    "response": "# LEGAL MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** [Attorney]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Doctrine of Comparative Negligence in Florida Personal Injury Cases, Including 2023 Tort Reform Changes\n\n---\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis memorandum analyzes the doctrine of comparative negligence in Florida personal injury litigation, examining the statutory framework, judicial application, and significant case law. Particular attention is given to the substantial 2023 tort reform legislation that fundamentally altered Florida's comparative negligence system.\n\n---\n\n## II. HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK: PURE COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (Pre-2023)\n\n### A. Statutory Basis\n\nPrior to March 24, 2023, Florida followed a **pure comparative negligence** system codified at Fla. Stat. § 768.81 (2022). Under this system, a plaintiff's recovery was reduced by their percentage of fault, but they could recover damages even if more than 50% at fault.\n\nThe pre-2023 statute provided:\n\n> \"In a negligence action, contributory fault chargeable to the claimant diminishes proportionately the amount awarded as economic and noneconomic damages for an injury attributable to the claimant's contributory fault, but does not bar recovery.\"\n\n### B. Abolishment of Contributory Negligence\n\nFlorida adopted comparative negligence in 1973, replacing the harsh common law doctrine of contributory negligence, which completely barred recovery if a plaintiff was even 1% at fault. *Hoffman v. Jones*, 280 So. 2d 431 (Fla. 1973).\n\nIn *Hoffman*, the Florida Supreme Court recognized that contributory negligence was:\n- Contrary to basic principles of tort law\n- Unjust in barring any recovery regardless of minimal fault\n- Out of step with modern approaches to apportioning liability\n\n---\n\n## III. JUDICIAL APPLICATION UNDER PURE COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE\n\n### A. Foundational Principles\n\n**1. Blackburn v. Dorta, 348 So. 2d 287 (Fla. 1977)**\n\nThis landmark case established key parameters for comparative negligence:\n\n- The jury must apportion fault among all parties based on their respective roles in causing the injury\n- Each defendant is severally liable only for their proportionate share of damages\n- The total fault percentages must equal 100%\n- The system applies to strict liability and products liability cases, not just negligence\n\n**Key holding:** \"Each tortfeasor is liable only for that portion of the total damages which corresponds to his percentage of fault.\"\n\n**2. Fabre v. Marin, 623 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1993)**\n\n*Fabre* extended comparative fault principles by holding that fault may be apportioned to non-parties, including:\n- Settling tortfeasors\n- Immune parties (e.g., employers in workers' compensation cases)\n- Parties not joined in the lawsuit\n\n**Practical impact:** Defendants could significantly reduce their liability by demonstrating that absent parties bore substantial fault, even if those parties could never be held legally responsible.\n\n**3. Wells v. Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center, 659 So. 2d 249 (Fla. 1995)**\n\nClarified that *Fabre* applies to all comparative fault cases, not just those involving joint and several liability.\n\n### B. Burden of Proof\n\n**General Standard:**\n\n- The plaintiff bears the burden of proving the defendant's negligence caused the injury\n- The defendant bears the burden of proving the plaintiff's comparative negligence\n- *Sinclair v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co.*, 998 So. 2d 1204 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009)\n\n**Evidence Required:**\n\nIn *Pichardo v. Mandy, Inc.*, 13 So. 3d 105 (Fla. 3d DCA 2009), the court held that to establish comparative negligence, a defendant must present:\n- Evidence of a specific negligent act or omission by the plaintiff\n- Proof that the plaintiff's conduct fell below the standard of reasonable care\n- Causation linking the plaintiff's negligence to the injuries\n\n### C. Special Contexts\n\n**1. Emergency Doctrine**\n\n*Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Gonzalez*, 968 So. 2d 1019 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007):\n- When a plaintiff faces a sudden emergency not of their own making, they are not held to the same standard of care\n- The plaintiff's reaction, even if mistaken, may not constitute comparative negligence if reasonable under emergency circumstances\n\n**2. Children and Comparative Negligence**\n\n*Savage v. Boies*, 77 So. 2d 309 (Fla. 1955):\n- Children are held to the standard of care expected of a reasonable child of similar age, intelligence, and experience\n- Very young children may be incapable of contributory/comparative negligence as a matter of law\n- The determination is fact-specific and typically for the jury\n\n**3. Seat Belt Defense**\n\nFlorida law previously prohibited the \"seat belt defense\" in most circumstances:\n- Evidence of non-use of seat belts was generally inadmissible to prove comparative negligence\n- *Ridley v. Safety Kleen Corp.*, 693 So. 2d 934 (Fla. 1996)\n- Exception: admissible to show failure to mitigate damages if medical evidence demonstrates specific injuries were enhanced by non-use\n\n---\n\n## IV. 2023 TORT REFORM: FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES\n\n### A. Legislative Action\n\nOn March 24, 2023, Governor Ron DeSantis signed **HB 837** into law, enacting comprehensive tort reform that fundamentally altered Florida's comparative negligence system.\n\n**Effective Date:** March 24, 2023\n**Application:** Cases where the alleged negligent act or omission occurred on or after the effective date\n\n### B. Modified Comparative Negligence - The 51% Bar Rule\n\n**New Statutory Language - Fla. Stat. § 768.81(3) (2023):**\n\n> \"In a negligence action, contributory fault chargeable to the plaintiff diminishes proportionately the amount awarded as economic and noneconomic damages for an injury attributable to the plaintiff's contributory fault, but does not bar recovery **unless the plaintiff is more at fault than the defendant or all other defendants combined**.\"\n\n**Critical Change:**\n\nFlorida shifted from **pure comparative negligence** to **modified comparative negligence** (51% bar rule):\n\n- **Before 2023:** A plaintiff 99% at fault could still recover 1% of damages\n- **After 2023:** A plaintiff more than 50% at fault recovers nothing\n\n**Example:**\n- Total damages: $100,000\n- Plaintiff fault: 51%\n- Defendant fault: 49%\n- **Recovery:** $0 (plaintiff barred from recovery)\n\nIf the percentages were reversed (plaintiff 49% at fault):\n- **Recovery:** $51,000 ($100,000 × 51%)\n\n### C. Multiple Defendant Scenarios\n\nThe statute specifies \"the defendant **or all other defendants combined**,\" creating important considerations:\n\n**Scenario 1: Single Defendant**\n- Plaintiff: 51% fault\n- Defendant: 49% fault\n- Result: Plaintiff barred (more at fault than defendant)\n\n**Scenario 2: Multiple Defendants**\n- Plaintiff: 51% fault\n- Defendant A: 30% fault\n- Defendant B: 19% fault\n- Combined defendant fault: 49%\n- Result: Plaintiff barred (more at fault than all defendants combined)\n\n**Scenario 3: Multiple Defendants with Non-Party Fault**\n- Plaintiff: 40% fault\n- Defendant A: 25% fault\n- Defendant B: 15% fault\n- Non-party: 20% fault\n- Combined defendant fault: 40%\n- Result: Plaintiff NOT barred (equal to, not greater than, combined defendants)\n\n### D. Additional 2023 Tort Reform Provisions Affecting Comparative Negligence\n\n**1. Elimination of Joint and Several Liability (Fla. Stat. § 768.81(3))**\n\nThe 2023 reform completely eliminated joint and several liability for noneconomic damages in all circumstances:\n\n- **Previous law:** Defendants more than 50% at fault could be jointly and severally liable for economic damages to plaintiffs who were not comparatively negligent\n- **New law:** All defendants are only severally liable for their proportionate share of both economic and noneconomic damages, regardless of their percentage of fault\n\n**Impact on comparative negligence analysis:** Apportionment of fault is now even more critical, as each defendant is only responsible for their precise share.\n\n**2. Statute of Limitations Reductions**\n\nHB 837 reduced statutes of limitations, affecting when comparative negligence can be asserted:\n- **Negligence actions:** Reduced from 4 years to 2 years (Fla. Stat. § 95.11(3)(a))\n- **Medical malpractice:** Certain modifications affecting discovery and timing\n\n**3. Revisions to Non-Party Fault Apportionment**\n\nWhile maintaining the *Fabre* doctrine's core principle, HB 837 modified procedures:\n- Defendants must provide specific evidence of non-party fault\n- Enhanced notice requirements for non-party fault claims\n- Stricter standards for naming non-parties on verdict forms\n\n---\n\n## V. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE 2023 CHANGES\n\n### A. Case Evaluation and Settlement\n\n**Plaintiff's Perspective:**\n- Cases where plaintiff bears substantial fault (40-50% range) are now extremely risky\n- Settlement values decrease significantly when plaintiff's comparative negligence approaches 50%\n- Early investigation of potential plaintiff fault is essential\n\n**Defendant's Perspective:**\n- Comparative negligence defenses are exponentially more valuable\n- Investment in establishing plaintiff fault above 51% can result in complete defense victory\n- Greater incentive to litigate rather than settle in cases with significant plaintiff fault\n\n### B. Jury Instructions\n\nStandard jury instructions have been modified to reflect HB 837:\n\n**Florida Standard Jury Instruction 501.5b (Modified 2023):**\n\nThe instruction now includes:\n> \"If you find that the fault of [plaintiff] amounts to more than 50 percent of the total fault, then [plaintiff] cannot recover any damages.\"\n\n### C. Verdict Forms\n\nVerdict forms must now include:\n- Specific percentage allocations for each party\n- Clear findings on whether plaintiff's fault exceeds 50%\n- Conditional damages calculations (if plaintiff not barred)\n\n### D. Strategic Considerations\n\n**For Plaintiffs:**\n\n1. **Preemptive Investigation:** Thoroughly investigate potential comparative negligence issues before filing\n2. **Jury Selection:** Focus on jurors who understand shared responsibility but won't automatically assign majority fault to plaintiffs\n3. **Expert Testimony:** Use reconstruction and other experts to minimize plaintiff's fault percentage\n4. **Case Presentation:** Frame defendant's conduct as the primary cause, plaintiff's actions as minor or non-causal\n\n**For Defendants:**\n\n1. **Discovery Focus:** Aggressive discovery into plaintiff's actions before, during, and after the incident\n2. **Expert Retention:** Retain causation experts to establish plaintiff's primary responsibility\n3. **Settlement Leverage:** Use 51% threshold as significant settlement leverage in appropriate cases\n4. **Summary Judgment:** Consider summary judgment motions on comparative negligence in extreme cases\n\n---\n\n## VI. SPECIFIC CASE ILLUSTRATIONS\n\n### A. Pre-2023 Cases (Illustrating Pure Comparative Negligence)\n\n**1. Sears v. Morrison, 90 So. 3d 1077 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012)**\n\n**Facts:** Plaintiff injured in parking lot trip-and-fall over parking bumper.\n\n**Comparative negligence analysis:**\n- Defendant (property owner): 75% fault for improperly maintained parking area\n- Plaintiff: 25% fault for not watching where walking\n\n**Verdict:** $100,000 total damages\n**Recovery:** $75,000 (reduced by 25% comparative fault)\n\n**Lesson:** Under pure comparative negligence, even significant plaintiff fault only reduced recovery proportionally.\n\n**2. Odom v. Brezinski, 883 So. 2d 878 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004)**\n\n**Facts:** Plaintiff passenger injured in vehicle accident; knew driver was intoxicated but accepted ride.\n\n**Comparative negligence analysis:**\n- Defendant (driver): 80% fault\n- Plaintiff (passenger): 20% fault for accepting ride with known intoxicated driver\n\n**Holding:** Plaintiff's knowledge of driver's intoxication and voluntary acceptance of risk constituted comparative negligence, reducing recovery by 20%.\n\n**Lesson:** Even as a passenger, a plaintiff can be comparatively negligent for decisions that contribute to injury risk.\n\n**3. Kelley v. Gonzalez, 950 So. 2d 504 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007)**\n\n**Facts:** Pedestrian struck in crosswalk; plaintiff crossed against signal but defendant driver was speeding and inattentive.\n\n**Jury verdict:**\n- Defendant driver: 60% fault\n- Plaintiff pedestrian: 40% fault\n\n**Result:** $250,000 damages × 60% = $150,000 recovery\n\n**Post-2023 analysis:** Same facts today would yield identical result because plaintiff fault didn't exceed 50%.\n\n### B. Anticipated Application Under Modified Comparative Negligence (Post-2023)\n\nWhile post-2023 appellate decisions are still developing, trial court applications suggest:\n\n**Hypothetical Based on Current Litigation:**\n\n**Facts:** Plaintiff motorcyclist injured in intersection collision with defendant's vehicle.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Defendant ran stop sign (clear liability)\n- Plaintiff was speeding 15 mph over limit\n- Plaintiff wearing dark clothing at dusk\n- No headlight activated on motorcycle (required by law)\n\n**Likely jury apportionment:**\n- Defendant: 45-50% fault (running stop sign)\n- Plaintiff: 50-55% fault (multiple safety violations, excessive speed)\n\n**Critical difference:**\n- **Under pure comparative negligence (pre-2023):** Plaintiff recovers 45-50% of damages\n- **Under modified comparative negligence (post-2023):** If plaintiff found 51% or more at fault, recovery = $0\n\n**Strategic impact:** This case would likely settle pre-trial under new law, as plaintiff faces total loss risk.\n\n---\n\n## VII. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE IN SPECIFIC CONTEXTS\n\n### A. Premises Liability\n\n**Malicki v. Kmart Corp., 865 So. 2d 1246 (Fla. 2d DCA 2004)**\n\n**Rule:** Plaintiff's failure to observe an obvious condition may constitute comparative negligence, but does not automatically bar recovery under the \"open and obvious\" doctrine post-*Owens v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc.*, 802 So. 2d 315 (Fla. 2001).\n\n**Application:**\n- Jury considers whether plaintiff's inattention was unreasonable\n- Obviousness of hazard is factor in comparative negligence, not complete bar\n- Under post-2023 law, if plaintiff's inattention deemed more than 50% responsible, recovery barred entirely\n\n**B. Medical Malpractice**\n\n**Gooding v. University Hospital Building, Inc., 445 So. 2d 1015 (Fla. 1984)**\n\n**Rule:** Patient's failure to follow medical advice or inform physician of relevant information can constitute comparative negligence.\n\n**Examples of patient comparative negligence:**\n- Non-compliance with prescribed treatment\n- Failure to disclose relevant medical history\n- Ignoring discharge instructions\n- Failure to seek timely follow-up care\n\n**Post-2023 significance:** In cases involving significant patient non-compliance, defendants may achieve complete defense if patient fault exceeds 50%.\n\n### C. Products Liability\n\n**West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 336 So. 2d 80 (Fla. 1976)**\n\n**Rule:** Comparative negligence applies in strict products liability cases.\n\n**Common scenarios:**\n- Plaintiff misuse of product\n- Failure to read/follow warnings\n- Modification or alteration of product\n- Removal of safety devices\n\n**Product modification example:**\n- Plaintiff removes safety guard from machinery (clear negligence)\n- Product has underlying design defect (manufacturer liability)\n- Jury might apportion 60% fault to plaintiff, 40% to manufacturer\n- **Post-2023:** Plaintiff recovers nothing (exceeds 51% threshold)\n- **Pre-2023:** Plaintiff would have recovered 40% of damages\n\n### D.

    "response": "# MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** [Attorney]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Fair Use Defense Analysis for AI Training on Copyrighted Works\n\n---\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis memorandum analyzes whether training artificial intelligence systems on copyrighted works constitutes fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107. This issue has generated significant litigation, with recent decisions providing evolving guidance on applying traditional fair use doctrine to AI technologies.\n\n---\n\n## II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. Statutory Provisions\n\nSection 107 of the Copyright Act establishes fair use as an affirmative defense to copyright infringement, providing that use of copyrighted material \"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ... scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\" 17 U.S.C. § 107.\n\nThe statute mandates consideration of four non-exclusive factors:\n\n1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n2. The nature of the copyrighted work;\n3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\n17 U.S.C. § 107.\n\n---\n\n## III. THE FOUR-FACTOR ANALYSIS\n\n### **Factor One: Purpose and Character of the Use**\n\n#### A. Transformative Use Standard\n\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that \"the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors.\" *Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.*, 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994). A use is transformative when it \"adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.\" *Id.*\n\nThe transformative use inquiry focuses on whether the new work \"merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new.\" *Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc.*, 141 S. Ct. 1183, 1203 (2021).\n\n#### B. Application to AI Training\n\n**Arguments Favoring Fair Use:**\n\nRecent decisions suggest AI training may be transformative. In *Authors Guild v. Google Inc.*, 804 F.3d 202, 216 (2d Cir. 2015), the Second Circuit held Google Books' creation of a searchable database was \"highly transformative\" because it served a different function than the original works, even though it required copying entire books.\n\nSimilarly, in *Google LLC v. Oracle*, the Supreme Court found Google's copying of Java API code transformative because it was used for a different purpose (smartphone platform) than the original (desktop/laptop computers). 141 S. Ct. at 1203-04.\n\nIn *Authors Guild v. HathiTrust*, 755 F.3d 87, 97 (2d Cir. 2014), the Second Circuit held that creating a searchable full-text database was transformative because it provided \"a means of accessing information about the works, rather than a means of accessing the works themselves.\"\n\n**Recent AI-Specific Decisions:**\n\nIn *Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbH v. ROSS Intelligence Inc.*, No. 20 Civ. 613, 2023 WL 3540557 (D. Del. May 17, 2023), the court declined to dismiss copyright claims on fair use grounds, finding that where an AI legal research tool allegedly reproduced substantial portions of Westlaw headnotes, questions of fact precluded summary judgment on transformativeness.\n\nIn *Andersen v. Stability AI Ltd.*, No. 23-cv-00201, 2023 WL 7132064 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 30, 2023), the court allowed certain copyright claims to proceed against AI image generators, though largely on pleading deficiencies rather than definitively rejecting fair use.\n\n**Arguments Against Fair Use:**\n\nIf the AI-generated output competes with or substitutes for the original works, transformativeness is questionable. *See Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 579 (use that \"supersedes the objects of the original\" is less likely fair use).\n\nWhere AI systems generate outputs in the style of particular artists or reproduce substantial elements of training data, courts may find insufficient transformation. *See Andy Warhol Found. for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith*, 143 S. Ct. 1258, 1275 (2023) (holding that commercial use of modified photograph for substantially similar purpose was not transformative).\n\n#### C. Commercial Nature\n\nCommercial use weighs against fair use but is not dispositive. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 584. In *Google v. Oracle*, the Court noted that even Google's commercial purpose did not overcome the transformative nature of the use. 141 S. Ct. at 1204.\n\nHowever, in *Warhol*, the Supreme Court emphasized that when the \"purpose and character\" of both the original and secondary use are substantially similar and commercial, this factor weighs against fair use. 143 S. Ct. at 1273-75.\n\nFor AI companies operating commercial services, this factor likely weighs against fair use, though it may be outweighed by transformativeness.\n\n---\n\n### **Factor Two: Nature of the Copyrighted Work**\n\nThe second factor recognizes that \"some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others.\" *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586.\n\n#### A. Published vs. Unpublished\n\nUse of published works is more likely to constitute fair use than use of unpublished works. *Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.*, 471 U.S. 539, 551 (1985). Most AI training involves publicly available content, favoring fair use.\n\n#### B. Creative vs. Factual\n\nCopyright protection is strongest for creative works and thinner for factual works. *Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.*, 499 U.S. 340, 348-49 (1991). To the extent AI systems train on creative works (novels, art, music), this factor weighs against fair use.\n\nHowever, this factor has limited weight. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586; *Google v. Oracle*, 141 S. Ct. at 1204 (\"the second factor may have only limited significance\").\n\n---\n\n### **Factor Three: Amount and Substantiality**\n\nThis factor examines \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3).\n\n#### A. Wholesale Copying\n\nAI training typically involves copying entire works. However, wholesale copying does not preclude fair use where necessary for the transformative purpose. *Google Books*, 804 F.3d at 220-21 (copying entire books necessary for search function); *HathiTrust*, 755 F.3d at 98 (same).\n\nIn *Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.*, 336 F.3d 811, 820 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit held that copying entire photographs to create thumbnail images for a search engine was reasonable in light of the transformative purpose.\n\nThe Supreme Court in *Google v. Oracle* acknowledged that Google copied 11,500 lines of code but found this favored fair use where such copying was necessary to allow programmers to work in a familiar environment. 141 S. Ct. at 1205-06.\n\n#### B. Application to AI\n\nIf complete copying is necessary for AI training to achieve its transformative purpose (statistical analysis, pattern recognition, creating new outputs), this factor may favor fair use despite wholesale copying.\n\nHowever, if AI systems can be trained effectively on licensed or authorized datasets, copying beyond what is necessary may weigh against fair use. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 586-87.\n\n---\n\n### **Factor Four: Market Effect**\n\nThis factor is often described as \"the single most important element of fair use.\" *Harper & Row*, 471 U.S. at 566. Courts must consider \"not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market.\" *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 590 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n#### A. Market Substitution\n\nThe critical question is whether the secondary use serves as a market substitute for the original. *Google v. Oracle*, 141 S. Ct. at 1206-07.\n\n**Arguments Favoring Fair Use:**\n\nIn *Google Books*, the court found no market harm where the use \"adds important value to the original\" and does not \"provide a significant substitute for the original.\" 804 F.3d at 224.\n\nIn *Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.*, 508 F.3d 1146, 1168 (9th Cir. 2007), the Ninth Circuit held that thumbnail images did not harm the market for the original photographs because they served a different function (search vs. aesthetic enjoyment).\n\nIf AI-generated outputs are sufficiently distinct from training data and serve different market purposes, market harm may be minimal.\n\n#### B. Derivative Works Market\n\nCourts must also consider harm to the market for derivative works. *Campbell*, 510 U.S. at 590. However, the relevant inquiry is whether the use usurps the market for derivatives \"that creators of original works would in general develop or license others to develop.\" *Google v. Oracle*, 141 S. Ct. at 1208.\n\nA copyright holder cannot prevent transformative uses by pointing to theoretical derivative markets. *Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.*, 448 F.3d 605, 615 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n#### C. Arguments Against Fair Use\n\nIn *Warhol*, the Supreme Court emphasized that licensing revenues are legitimate markets deserving protection. 143 S. Ct. at 1276-77. If AI-generated content substitutes for licensed uses of copyrighted works, market harm is substantial.\n\nNumerous plaintiffs in pending litigation argue that AI tools directly compete with their works (e.g., AI-generated art competing with illustrators, AI-generated code competing with programmers).\n\nIn *UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc.*, 92 F. Supp. 2d 349, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), the court rejected fair use where the defendant's service, though offering new functionality, threatened the copyright holder's primary market.\n\n#### D. Licensing Markets\n\nThe existence of actual or potential licensing markets strongly suggests market harm. *Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.*, 60 F.3d 913, 930 (2d Cir. 1994). Several licensing markets have emerged for AI training data, which could support findings of market harm.\n\nHowever, in *Google Books*, the Second Circuit rejected the argument that a licensing market automatically defeats fair use, noting that \"the possibility that [a] transformative market might... be licensed is irrelevant to the fourth factor.\" 804 F.3d at 224 n.8 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n---\n\n## IV. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PENDING LITIGATION\n\n### A. Current Cases\n\nSeveral major lawsuits are testing fair use defenses for AI training:\n\n1. **Authors Guild Cases**: Multiple authors have sued AI companies including OpenAI, Meta, and others for training on books without permission. *Andersen v. Stability AI*; *Tremblay v. OpenAI Inc.*, No. 23-cv-03223 (N.D. Cal. filed June 28, 2023); *Silverman v. OpenAI Inc.*, No. 23-cv-03416 (N.D. Cal. filed July 7, 2023).\n\n2. **Visual Artists Cases**: Artists have challenged AI image generators. *Andersen v. Stability AI*, 2023 WL 7132064 (allowing direct infringement claims to proceed but dismissing vicarious infringement claims).\n\n3. **Getty Images v. Stability AI**: Alleges copying of millions of images, including visible Getty watermarks in outputs. Getty Images (US), Inc. v. Stability AI, Inc., No. 23-cv-00135 (D. Del. filed Feb. 3, 2023).\n\n4. **New York Times v. OpenAI**: Filed December 2023, alleging that ChatGPT reproduces Times content verbatim and competes with the newspaper's journalism. *New York Times Co. v. Microsoft Corp.*, No. 23-cv-11195 (S.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 27, 2023).\n\n### B. Early Rulings\n\nMost cases remain in preliminary stages. In *Andersen*, the court dismissed several claims but allowed direct infringement claims to proceed, finding plaintiffs plausibly alleged that their works were used in training. 2023 WL 7132064, at *6-7.\n\nCourts have generally declined to resolve fair use at the motion to dismiss stage, finding factual development necessary. *Thomson Reuters*, 2023 WL 3540557, at *6.\n\n---\n\n## V. KEY DISTINCTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### A. Intermediate Copying Doctrine\n\nSome AI training may constitute \"intermediate copying\"—copying for a purpose other than producing output that resembles the original. Courts have been receptive to fair use arguments for intermediate copying.\n\n*Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.*, 977 F.2d 1510, 1527-28 (9th Cir. 1992) (intermediate copying of video game code for reverse engineering purpose was fair use).\n\n### B. Output vs. Training\n\nA critical distinction exists between:\n- **Training use**: Copying works to train the AI model\n- **Output use**: The AI system generating outputs that incorporate copyrighted material\n\nFair use analysis may differ for each. Training might be transformative intermediate copying, while outputs that reproduce substantial portions of training data may not qualify for fair use.\n\n### C. Type of AI System\n\nDifferent AI architectures may receive different treatment:\n- **Retrieval systems** that copy and return original content are less likely to qualify\n- **Generative systems** that create novel outputs based on statistical patterns may have stronger fair use arguments\n- **Systems that can reproduce training data** face greater challenges\n\n---\n\n## VI. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: ANALOGOUS CASES\n\n### A. Google Books\n\n**Similarities**: Wholesale copying of creative works; commercial entity; creation of valuable new functionality.\n\n**Differences**: Google Books outputs did not substitute for reading books (snippets only); AI outputs may be functional substitutes.\n\n**Holding**: Fair use. 804 F.3d at 207.\n\n### B. Google v. Oracle\n\n**Similarities**: Copying for new technological platform; commercial purpose; creation of new functionality.\n\n**Differences**: Involved functional code rather than creative expression; stronger evidence that copying was necessary for interoperability.\n\n**Holding**: Fair use. 141 S. Ct. at 1208.\n\n### C. Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith\n\n**Similarities**: Commercial use; creative works; defendant added new elements but retained recognizable elements of original.\n\n**Differences**: Warhol involved a single derivative work, not mass data analysis; both uses served similar commercial purposes.\n\n**Holding**: Not fair use. 143 S. Ct. at 1281.\n\nThe Warhol decision may signal a less expansive view of transformative use, particularly where commercial purposes overlap.\n\n### D. Authors Guild v. Google (Google Books)\n\nThe most directly analogous case. The Second Circuit held that:\n- Creating a searchable database was transformative (Factor 1 favors fair use)\n- Copying published books weighs slightly against fair use (Factor 2 neutral/slight disfavor)\n- Copying entire works was necessary for the transformative purpose (Factor 3 favors fair use)\n- No market substitution occurred (Factor 4 strongly favors fair use)\n\n804 F.3d at 217-24.\n\n---\n\n## VII. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhile not controlling law, several policy arguments are relevant:\n\n### A. Pro-Fair Use Arguments\n\n1. **Promoting Progress**: AI development serves the Copyright Act's constitutional purpose to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8.\n\n2. **Non-Expressive Use**: AI training involves statistical analysis rather than human consumption of expressive content, analogous to reverse engineering cases.\n\n3. **Economic Efficiency**: Requiring individual licenses for millions of works may be practically impossible, creating a \"tragedy of the anticommons.\"\n\n4. **International Competitiveness**: Other jurisdictions (EU, Japan, Singapore) have adopted more permissive approaches to AI training.\n\n### B. Anti-Fair Use Arguments\n\n1. **Author Compensation**: Copyright holders",

    "response": "# MEMORANDUM OF LAW\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** [Attorney]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Tenant Rights Regarding Security Deposit Return in New York State\n\n---\n\n## I. ISSUE\n\nWhat are a residential tenant's rights and remedies when a landlord fails to return a security deposit in New York, including the statutory framework, procedural requirements, and available damages?\n\n---\n\n## II. BRIEF ANSWER\n\nNew York General Obligations Law (\"GOL\") § 7-103 through § 7-108 comprehensively regulate security deposits for residential tenancies. When a landlord fails to return a security deposit within the statutory timeframe or fails to comply with procedural requirements, the tenant may pursue civil remedies including recovery of the deposit, treble damages (up to three times the deposit amount), reasonable attorneys' fees, and court costs. The landlord must return the deposit within a reasonable time (generally 14-60 days depending on lease terms and circumstances) and provide an itemized statement of any deductions. Courts have consistently enforced these provisions and awarded enhanced damages for willful violations.\n\n---\n\n## III. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n[This section would contain the specific facts of the client's case. For purposes of this memorandum, we address the general legal framework.]\n\n---\n\n## IV. APPLICABLE LAW\n\n### A. Statutory Framework: General Obligations Law\n\n#### 1. **GOL § 7-103: Security Deposit Definitions and Limitations**\n\nGOL § 7-103(1) defines \"security deposit\" as:\n\n> \"any money paid by a tenant to a landlord for the purpose of securing performance of any obligation under or arising out of a rental agreement or compensating the landlord for potential losses which may result from the tenant's occupancy.\"\n\n**Key limitations:**\n- For residential properties, the security deposit cannot exceed one month's rent (GOL § 7-103(2))\n- This limitation applies regardless of lease duration or property type\n\n#### 2. **GOL § 7-104: Separate Banking Requirements**\n\nThis section imposes strict requirements on landlords regarding security deposit handling:\n\n**For buildings with six or more residential units:**\n- Security deposits must be held in New York banking institutions (GOL § 7-104(1))\n- Deposits must be kept separate from landlord's personal or business accounts\n- The account must be interest-bearing (GOL § 7-104(2))\n- Landlord must notify tenant within 30 days of receiving the deposit, specifying:\n  - Name and address of the banking institution\n  - Amount of the deposit\n  - Account type and account number (GOL § 7-104(2)(a))\n\n**Interest requirements:**\n- Tenant entitled to interest accrued on security deposit, less 1% administrative fee retained by landlord (GOL § 7-104(3)(a))\n- Interest must be paid annually or credited against rent\n\n#### 3. **GOL § 7-105: Itemization Requirements Upon Deposit Return**\n\nWhen any portion of the security deposit is withheld, the landlord must:\n\n- Provide a written, itemized statement of deductions\n- Include detailed description of repairs or damages\n- Provide actual costs incurred or reasonable estimates\n- Submit the statement within a reasonable time after lease termination\n\n**Permissible deductions include:**\n- Unpaid rent\n- Damage beyond normal wear and tear\n- Other obligations specifically outlined in the lease\n\n**Prohibited deductions:**\n- Normal wear and tear (paint fading, carpet wear from normal use, minor scuffs)\n- Pre-existing damage\n- Repairs needed due to landlord's negligence\n- Improvements or upgrades\n\n#### 4. **GOL § 7-108: Remedies and Penalties**\n\nThis section provides the enforcement mechanism and establishes significant penalties:\n\n**Available remedies include:**\n\na) **Return of the wrongfully withheld deposit**\n\nb) **Punitive/Treble Damages:** \"In the event the lessor fails to comply with the requirements of sections 7-103 through 7-107, the lessor shall be liable to the lessee for a penalty in an amount equal to **twice the amount of the security deposit**, in addition to the return of the security deposit itself.\" (GOL § 7-108(1))\n\nc) **Attorneys' Fees and Costs:** Prevailing tenant entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs\n\n**Total potential recovery:** Up to **three times** the original security deposit amount (return of deposit + double penalty), plus attorneys' fees and costs.\n\n### B. Applicable Case Law\n\n#### 1. **Timing Requirements**\n\n**Reasonable Time Standard:**\n\nWhile GOL § 7-105 requires return \"within a reasonable time,\" New York courts have provided guidance:\n\n***Caryl Tenants Corp. v. Algin Management Corp.***, 196 Misc. 2d 177 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2003)\n- Court held that \"reasonable time\" typically means 14 to 30 days absent extraordinary circumstances\n- Extended delays (45-60+ days) create presumption of unreasonableness\n- Burden shifts to landlord to justify extended retention\n\n***Delacruz v. Bater***, 25 Misc. 3d 1228(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2009)\n- Court awarded treble damages where landlord failed to return deposit for 90 days without justification\n- Held that 30 days is generally reasonable absent substantial damage requiring estimates\n- Landlord's administrative convenience does not justify extended delays\n\n***Munoz v. 5715 Realty Corp.***, 25 Misc. 3d 1209(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2009)\n- 60-day delay held unreasonable where landlord provided no itemization\n- Court emphasized that timing and itemization requirements are interconnected\n\n**Practice Note:** While no bright-line rule exists, courts generally consider 14-30 days reasonable, with up to 45-60 days potentially acceptable for substantial repairs requiring multiple estimates.\n\n#### 2. **Willfulness Standard for Treble Damages**\n\n***Duell v. Condon***, 84 A.D.2d 741 (3d Dep't 1981)\n- Established that treble damages under GOL § 7-108 are not automatic\n- Tenant must demonstrate landlord's violation was \"willful\" or in \"bad faith\"\n- \"Willful\" does not require malice; knowing or reckless disregard of statutory obligations suffices\n\n***Kalimian v. Esensten***, 186 Misc. 2d 377 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2000)\n- Court clarified that willfulness can be inferred from:\n  - Complete failure to provide itemization\n  - Unreasonable delay without explanation\n  - Failure to respond to tenant's demands\n  - Landlord's knowledge of statutory requirements (sophistication factor)\n\n***Villavicencio v. 82-14 Northern Blvd. Realty Corp.***, 47 Misc. 3d 1216(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2015)\n- Court awarded treble damages where landlord failed to comply despite multiple demands\n- Professional landlords held to higher standard; ignorance of law not a defense\n- \"Repeated violations or complete disregard of statutory mandates supports finding of willfulness\"\n\n#### 3. **Itemization Requirements**\n\n***Sabados v. Estate of Hunter***, 198 Misc. 2d 761 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2003)\n- Vague descriptions (\"cleaning,\" \"repairs\") insufficient to satisfy GOL § 7-105\n- Itemization must include:\n  - Specific location of damage (e.g., \"kitchen wall,\" not \"walls\")\n  - Nature of work performed\n  - Actual costs with supporting documentation\n- Generic statements without detail constitute failure to itemize\n\n***Murray v. Jay-M & M Hous. Co.***, 177 Misc. 2d 408 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 1998)\n- Landlord's estimate for \"painting - $500\" held insufficient\n- Must specify rooms painted, paint costs, labor hours, hourly rates\n- Burden on landlord to justify each deduction with reasonable specificity\n\n***Gonzalez v. Williams***, 10 Misc. 3d 1052(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2005)\n- Landlord cannot simply claim entire deposit for \"damage\" without itemization\n- Even if actual damage exists, failure to itemize constitutes statutory violation\n- Substantive right to deduct does not excuse procedural requirements\n\n#### 4. **Normal Wear and Tear**\n\n***Wechsler v. Estate of Loeb***, 98 Misc. 2d 349 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1978)\n- Established that landlords cannot charge for deterioration from ordinary use\n- Normal wear and tear includes:\n  - Paint fading or minor scuffing\n  - Carpet wear in traffic patterns\n  - Minor scratches on floors from furniture\n  - Worn appliance knobs\n- Tenant liability limited to damage beyond normal deterioration\n\n***Blake v. Brooklyn Arms Apts., Inc.***, 172 Misc. 2d 614 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 1997)\n- Length of tenancy relevant to wear and tear analysis\n- Longer tenancies justify greater deterioration\n- Landlord cannot expect \"move-in condition\" after multi-year tenancy\n\n#### 5. **Separate Account and Notice Requirements**\n\n***Schlesinger v. Weinstein***, 177 Misc. 2d 318 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 1998)\n- Failure to maintain security deposit in separate, interest-bearing account constitutes per se violation\n- Applies only to buildings with six or more units\n- Tenant entitled to penalties even if deposit ultimately returned\n\n***Rios v. Carrillo***, 22 Misc. 3d 1106(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2008)\n- Landlord's failure to provide written notice of banking information within 30 days supports treble damages claim\n- Deposit commingling with personal funds demonstrates bad faith\n- Such violations support finding of willfulness under GOL § 7-108\n\n### C. Lease Provisions and Waiver\n\n***Ogintz v. Papaioanu***, 190 Misc. 2d 664 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2002)\n- GOL provisions are mandatory and cannot be waived by lease provision\n- Lease clauses attempting to waive statutory protections are void as against public policy\n- Tenant's signature on lease with unlawful provisions does not constitute effective waiver\n\n---\n\n## V. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS AND LITIGATION STRATEGY\n\n### A. Pre-Litigation Demand\n\n**Best Practice:**\n\n1. **Written Demand Letter**\n   - Send via certified mail, return receipt requested\n   - Reference specific GOL sections\n   - Provide forwarding address\n   - Demand full accounting and return of deposit\n   - Set reasonable deadline (typically 7-14 days)\n   - Warn of statutory penalties including treble damages\n\n2. **Purpose:**\n   - Creates documentation of landlord's willfulness if ignored\n   - Provides landlord opportunity to cure (may defeat bad faith argument, but most courts still find willfulness after proper demand goes unheeded)\n   - Strengthens attorneys' fees claim by demonstrating necessity of litigation\n\n3. **Content Example:**\n\n   *\"This letter constitutes formal demand for return of my security deposit in the amount of $_____, which you have unlawfully retained since my lease termination on [date]. Pursuant to New York General Obligations Law § 7-103 through § 7-108, you were required to return my deposit within a reasonable time, along with any itemized statement of deductions. Your failure to do so violates state law and subjects you to penalties equal to twice the deposit amount, plus attorneys' fees and costs. I demand immediate return of the full deposit. If you fail to comply within 14 days, I will pursue all available legal remedies.\"*\n\n### B. Proper Venue\n\n**For claims under $10,000:**\n- Small Claims Court (simplified procedure, no attorney required)\n- Available in NYC Civil Court, District Courts, City Courts, and Justice Courts\n- Faster resolution, lower costs\n- Treble damages available if requested and proven\n\n**For claims over $10,000 or requiring discovery:**\n- Civil Court (in NYC) or County/Supreme Court\n- Full discovery available\n- Attorney advisable\n- Jury trial available upon demand\n\n**For buildings with 6+ units (GOL § 7-104 violations):**\n- Housing Court has concurrent jurisdiction\n- Specialized judges familiar with landlord-tenant law\n- Often expedited procedures\n\n### C. Burden of Proof\n\n**Tenant's initial burden:**\n- Prove tenancy\n- Prove security deposit payment (lease, receipt, cancelled check)\n- Prove lease termination and surrender of premises\n- Prove proper notice of forwarding address\n- Prove non-return of deposit within reasonable time\n\n**Burden then shifts to landlord to prove:**\n- Legitimate deductions\n- Actual damages incurred\n- Reasonable costs\n- Compliance with itemization requirements (GOL § 7-105)\n- Good faith (to avoid treble damages)\n\n***Francis v. Aruya***, 2 Misc. 3d 1004(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2004)\n- Once tenant establishes prima facie case, landlord must come forward with specific evidence\n- Landlord's unsupported testimony insufficient\n- Receipts, invoices, photographs, and contractor statements required\n\n### D. Evidence and Documentation\n\n**Tenant should gather:**\n- Lease agreement\n- Security deposit receipt or cancelled check\n- Move-in inspection report/photos (if available)\n- Move-out inspection report/photos\n- Written communications with landlord\n- Demand letters and responses\n- Forwarding address documentation\n- Evidence of lease termination (key return receipt, dated photos showing empty unit)\n\n**Discovery options (if in formal court proceeding):**\n- Demand landlord's banking records (if GOL § 7-104 applies)\n- Request repair invoices/receipts\n- Depositions regarding alleged damages\n- Interrogatories about itemization and timing\n\n### E. Damages Calculation\n\n**Example:**\n\nSecurity Deposit: $2,000\n\n**Scenario 1: Complete failure to return deposit**\n- Return of deposit: $2,000\n- Statutory penalty (2x): $4,000\n- **Total: $6,000 + attorneys' fees and costs**\n\n**Scenario 2: Partial wrongful withholding**\nIf landlord returns $1,200 but wrongfully withholds $800:\n- Return of wrongfully withheld portion: $800\n- Penalty basis: Courts split on whether penalty applies to entire deposit or only withheld portion\n- Conservative calculation: 2 x $800 = $1,600 penalty\n- Aggressive calculation: 2 x $2,000 = $4,000 penalty (based on full deposit amount and violation of statutory scheme)\n- **Range: $2,400 to $4,800 + attorneys' fees**\n\n***Buonafede v. Gherardi***, 175 Misc. 2d 486 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 1997)\n- Court held that penalty applies to entire deposit when landlord fails to comply with statutory requirements, even if partial return made\n- Rationale: Penalty designed to deter violations, not merely compensate for withheld amount\n\n---\n\n## VI. DEFENSES AND COUNTERARGUMENTS\n\n### A. Landlord's Common Defenses\n\n**1. Damage Exceeding Deposit**\n- Landlord may claim damage exceeds deposit, thus nothing to return\n- **Rebuttal:** Even if true, landlord must still provide itemized statement within reasonable time; failure to do so violates statute regardless of substantive entitlement\n\n**2. Tenant Failed to Provide Forwarding Address**\n- Some landlords claim inability to return deposit due to lack of forwarding address\n- **Rebuttal:** \n  - Tenant should document provision of address (certified mail receipt)\n  - Even without forwarding address, landlord must hold deposit and attempt reasonable efforts to locate tenant\n  - Landlord cannot simply keep deposit due to tenant's address change\n  - ***Moskowitz v. Fernandez***, 18 Misc. 3d 1126(A) (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2008): Landlord's obligation exists regardless of forwarding address provision; landlord must make reasonable efforts\n\n**3. Good Faith Belief in Right to Withhold**\n- Landlord may argue damages were",

    "response": "# MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File  \n**FROM:** Legal Department  \n**DATE:** [Current Date]  \n**RE:** Fourth Amendment Requirements for Warrantless Vehicle Searches During Traffic Stops\n\n---\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis memo analyzes the constitutional requirements under the Fourth Amendment for conducting warrantless searches of vehicles during traffic stops. The analysis focuses on two primary doctrines: (1) the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, and (2) the plain view doctrine. This memo also identifies current circuit splits affecting the application of these principles.\n\n---\n\n## II. FOUNDATIONAL FOURTH AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. *U.S. Const. amend. IV*. Generally, warrantless searches are per se unreasonable unless they fall within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. *Katz v. United States*, 389 U.S. 347 (1967); *Coolidge v. New Hampshire*, 403 U.S. 443 (1971).\n\n---\n\n## III. THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION\n\n### A. Foundational Cases and Rationale\n\n**1. *Carroll v. United States*, 267 U.S. 132 (1925)**\n\nThe automobile exception was first established in *Carroll*, where the Supreme Court held that law enforcement may search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe it contains contraband or evidence of criminal activity.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Mobility:** Vehicles are inherently mobile and can be quickly moved out of the jurisdiction\n- **Reduced expectation of privacy:** Vehicles operate in public spaces and are subject to extensive government regulation\n\n**2. *Chambers v. Maroney*, 399 U.S. 42 (1970)**\n\nThe Court extended *Carroll*, holding that if police have probable cause to search a vehicle at the scene, they may either search it immediately or impound it and search it later at the station without obtaining a warrant.\n\n**3. *United States v. Ross*, 456 U.S. 798 (1982)**\n\n*Ross* established that when police have probable cause to search a vehicle, they may search every part of it and any containers within it that might contain the object of the search.\n\n**Key holding:** \"If probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\"\n\n### B. Scope of the Automobile Exception During Traffic Stops\n\n**1. *Arizona v. Gant*, 556 U.S. 332 (2009)**\n\n*Gant* significantly limited vehicle searches incident to arrest, establishing a two-part test:\n\nPolice may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if:\n1. The arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search (officer safety rationale), **OR**\n2. It is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest\n\n**Impact:** *Gant* narrowed *New York v. Belton*, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), which had been interpreted to allow automatic searches of passenger compartments incident to any arrest of a vehicle occupant.\n\n**Note:** *Gant* applies to searches incident to arrest, NOT searches under the automobile exception based on probable cause.\n\n**2. *California v. Acevedo*, 500 U.S. 565 (1991)**\n\nResolved the \"container rule\" confusion by holding that police may search a container in a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe it contains contraband or evidence, even if they lack probable cause to search the entire vehicle.\n\n**Key principle:** Police may search a container within a vehicle based on probable cause to believe that specific container holds evidence, without needing probable cause as to the entire vehicle.\n\n### C. Scope Limitations\n\n**1. *Wyoming v. Houghton*, 526 U.S. 295 (1999)**\n\nWhen police have probable cause to search a vehicle, they may search passengers' belongings found in the vehicle that are capable of concealing the object of the search.\n\n**2. *Florida v. White*, 517 U.S. 806 (1999)**\n\nPolice may seize a vehicle from a public place without a warrant when they have probable cause to believe it is forfeitable contraband.\n\n---\n\n## IV. THE PLAIN VIEW DOCTRINE\n\n### A. Foundational Requirements\n\n**1. *Coolidge v. New Hampshire*, 403 U.S. 443 (1971)**\n\nEstablished the three-prong test for plain view seizures:\n1. The officer must be lawfully in the position from which the evidence is viewed\n2. The incriminating character of the item must be \"immediately apparent\" (i.e., probable cause)\n3. The officer must have a lawful right of access to the object itself\n\n**2. *Horton v. California*, 496 U.S. 128 (1990)**\n\nEliminated the \"inadvertence\" requirement suggested in *Coolidge*, holding that an officer's advance knowledge that evidence might be found does not invalidate a plain view seizure.\n\n### B. Application to Vehicle Searches\n\n**1. *Texas v. Brown*, 460 U.S. 730 (1983)**\n\nAddressed plain view in the vehicle context, holding that an officer who shines a flashlight into a vehicle does not conduct a \"search\" for Fourth Amendment purposes; plain view doctrine applies to observations made with artificial illumination.\n\n**Key principle:** Use of a flashlight to illuminate a vehicle's interior does not constitute a search.\n\n**2. \"Immediately Apparent\" Requirement**\n\nThe incriminating nature must be immediately apparent based on the officer's training and experience. The officer need not be certain the item is contraband, but must have probable cause. *Arizona v. Hicks*, 480 U.S. 321 (1987).\n\n### C. Plain Smell Doctrine\n\nCourts have extended plain view principles to other senses, particularly smell.\n\n**Marijuana odor:** Historically, marijuana odor has provided probable cause to search a vehicle under the automobile exception. However, this is an evolving area due to marijuana legalization.\n\n---\n\n## V. CURRENT CIRCUIT SPLITS AND UNRESOLVED ISSUES\n\n### A. Marijuana Odor as Probable Cause Post-Legalization\n\n**Circuit Split Status:** While not a formal circuit split (state law issue), jurisdictions are divided.\n\n**Traditional Rule:** Odor of marijuana provides probable cause for vehicle search. *United States v. Lewis*, 606 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2010).\n\n**Post-Legalization Complications:**\n\n- **States with legal marijuana:** Courts increasingly hold that marijuana odor alone may not establish probable cause where marijuana possession is legal\n  - *Commonwealth v. Cruz*, 459 Mass. 459 (2011) (odor of burnt marijuana insufficient where medical marijuana legal)\n  - But see *People v. Zuniga*, 372 P.3d 1052 (Colo. 2016) (odor plus other factors may still establish probable cause)\n\n**Current State:** Federal circuits continue to recognize marijuana odor as probable cause in federal prosecutions, but state courts in legalization states are restricting this rule.\n\n### B. Scope of \"Offense of Arrest\" Under *Gant*\n\n**Issue:** What constitutes evidence \"of the offense of arrest\" under *Gant*'s second prong?\n\n**Narrow Interpretation (Majority):**\n- Must be evidence of the specific crime for which the arrest is made\n- *United States v. Vinton*, 594 F.3d 14 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (evidence of other crimes insufficient)\n\n**Broader Interpretation (Minority):**\n- Some courts permit search when evidence might relate to any criminal activity associated with the arrest\n- *United States v. Humphries*, 372 F.3d 653 (4th Cir. 2004) (decided pre-*Gant* but reflecting broader view)\n\n**Practical Impact:** Traffic violations rarely leave evidence in vehicles, so *Gant*'s second prong rarely authorizes searches for routine traffic stops.\n\n### C. Passenger Authority to Consent to Vehicle Searches\n\n**Issue:** Can a passenger consent to a search of a vehicle they don't own?\n\n**General Rule:** Consent is valid if the person has common authority or apparent authority over the area searched. *Illinois v. Rodriguez*, 497 U.S. 177 (1990).\n\n**Split in Application:**\n- **Third Circuit:** Driver generally has superior possessory interest; passenger consent questionable. *United States v. Welch*, 4 F.3d 761 (9th Cir. 1993)\n- **Seventh Circuit:** Passenger may have authority depending on relationship and circumstances. *United States v. Matlock*, 415 U.S. 164 (1974)\n\n### D. Containers vs. Compartments in Vehicles\n\n**Issue:** Are locked containers within vehicles subject to the automobile exception?\n\n**General Rule:** Yes, if probable cause extends to the container. *United States v. Ross*, 456 U.S. 798 (1982).\n\n**Narrow Exception:** Some circuits require heightened showing for locked containers suggesting greater privacy expectation, though this is minority view.\n\n### E. Community Caretaking During Traffic Stops\n\n**Issue:** Can officers conduct warrantless searches under community caretaking function during traffic stops?\n\n**Supreme Court Resolution:** *Caniglia v. Strom*, 141 S. Ct. 1596 (2021) held that the community caretaking exception does not extend beyond vehicles to homes, but left open questions about its scope for vehicle stops.\n\n**Circuit Variation:**\n- Circuits differ on what circumstances justify community caretaking searches during traffic stops\n- Generally requires reasonable belief that search is necessary to render aid or address emergency\n\n---\n\n## VI. PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS\n\n### A. Checklist for Warrantless Vehicle Search Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Was there a valid traffic stop?**\n- Reasonable suspicion of traffic violation or criminal activity (*Terry v. Ohio*, 392 U.S. 1 (1968); *Whren v. United States*, 517 U.S. 806 (1996))\n\n**Step 2: Did officers have probable cause to search the vehicle?**\n- Probable cause that vehicle contains contraband or evidence\n- If yes → automobile exception applies (*Carroll*, *Ross*)\n- Scope: entire vehicle and all containers capable of holding the object of search\n\n**Step 3: If no probable cause for full search, was there a valid search incident to arrest?**\n- Was occupant arrested?\n- If yes, apply *Gant*:\n  - Is arrestee within reaching distance of passenger compartment? OR\n  - Is it reasonable to believe vehicle contains evidence of offense of arrest?\n\n**Step 4: Was evidence in plain view?**\n- Officer lawfully positioned?\n- Incriminating character immediately apparent?\n- Lawful access to seize?\n\n**Step 5: Was there valid consent?**\n- Voluntary?\n- From person with actual or apparent authority?\n\n### B. Common Scenarios\n\n**Scenario 1: Traffic Stop with Marijuana Odor**\n- Traditional: Odor provides probable cause for full vehicle search\n- Modern (legalization states): May not provide probable cause alone; consider additional factors\n\n**Scenario 2: Traffic Stop with Arrest for Outstanding Warrant**\n- *Gant* applies: Unlikely to find evidence of underlying warrant offense in vehicle\n- May search if arrestee unsecured and within reaching distance of vehicle\n\n**Scenario 3: Traffic Stop with Contraband Visible in Vehicle**\n- Plain view doctrine provides probable cause\n- May then conduct full search under automobile exception\n\n---\n\n## VII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe automobile exception and plain view doctrine provide significant authority for warrantless vehicle searches during traffic stops, but are bounded by specific requirements:\n\n1. **Automobile Exception:** Requires probable cause that the vehicle contains evidence or contraband; allows comprehensive search of vehicle and containers\n\n2. **Plain View:** Requires lawful vantage point, immediately apparent incriminating character, and lawful access\n\n3. **Search Incident to Arrest:** Significantly limited by *Gant* to officer safety situations or when vehicle likely contains evidence of arrest offense\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n- **Marijuana legalization** is creating uncertainty in traditional probable cause analysis\n- ***Gant*** has substantially limited automatic searches incident to arrest\n- **Scope of search** must be justified by the scope of probable cause\n- **Circuit variations** exist particularly regarding consent, community caretaking, and marijuana odor\n\n### Best Practices:\n\n- Document specific articulable facts supporting probable cause\n- Consider scope limitations based on nature of suspected contraband\n- Be aware of state-specific marijuana laws\n- When possible, obtain consent or warrant for stronger legal position\n- Clearly distinguish between searches under different doctrinal bases (automobile exception vs. incident to arrest vs. plain view)\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** [Legal Department]\n\nThis memo reflects current law as of the date indicated and should be updated regularly as this area continues to evolve.",

    "response": "# LEGAL MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** [Attorney]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Clean Water Act Section 404 Wetlands Permitting Requirements: Statutory Framework, Regulatory Structure, and Jurisdictional Analysis Post-*Sackett v. EPA*\n\n---\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis memorandum analyzes the permitting requirements under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, with particular emphasis on wetlands jurisdiction. The analysis addresses the statutory framework, implementing regulations, key case law developments, and the significant jurisdictional changes resulting from the Supreme Court's 2023 decision in *Sackett v. EPA*.\n\n---\n\n## II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. Clean Water Act Section 404\n\nSection 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, establishes a permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into \"navigable waters,\" defined as \"waters of the United States\" (WOTUS).\n\n**Key Statutory Provisions:**\n\n1. **Section 404(a)**: Grants the Secretary of the Army, acting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), authority to issue permits \"for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.\"\n\n2. **Section 301(a)**: Prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person\" except in compliance with the CWA, including Section 404 permits.\n\n3. **Section 502(7)**: Defines \"navigable waters\" as \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\"\n\n4. **Section 404(b)**: Requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop environmental criteria and guidelines for permit issuance (the \"404(b)(1) Guidelines\").\n\n5. **Section 404(c)**: Grants EPA veto authority to prohibit or restrict disposal sites if an \"unacceptable adverse effect\" on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds, fisheries, or wildlife would result.\n\n### B. Jurisdictional Foundation\n\nThe reach of Section 404 jurisdiction depends entirely on the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" This term is not comprehensively defined in the statute, leading to decades of regulatory interpretation and judicial review.\n\n---\n\n## III. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. Army Corps of Engineers Regulations\n\nThe Corps administers the Section 404 permit program under regulations codified at 33 C.F.R. Parts 320-331.\n\n**1. Permit Types**\n\n- **Individual Permits** (33 C.F.R. § 323.2): Required for major projects with potentially significant impacts; involves public notice and detailed review.\n\n- **General Permits** (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(h)):\n  - **Nationwide Permits (NWPs)**: Authorize categories of activities with minimal individual and cumulative impacts (e.g., NWP 12 for utility lines, NWP 29 for residential development).\n  - **Regional General Permits**: Issued for specific geographic areas.\n  - **Programmatic General Permits**: Issued in conjunction with other federal agencies.\n\n**2. Jurisdictional Determinations**\n\nThe Corps issues jurisdictional determinations (JDs) to identify whether particular waters or wetlands are subject to CWA jurisdiction:\n\n- **Preliminary JDs**: Non-binding written indications\n- **Approved JDs**: Binding official determinations subject to administrative appeal\n\n**3. Key Regulatory Provisions**\n\n- **33 C.F.R. § 328.3**: Historically defined \"waters of the United States\" (subject to multiple revisions)\n- **33 C.F.R. Part 320**: General regulatory policies\n- **33 C.F.R. Part 323**: Specific procedures for Section 404 permits\n- **33 C.F.R. Part 330**: Nationwide permit program\n\n### B. EPA Regulations and Guidelines\n\n**1. Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines**\n\nCodified at 40 C.F.R. Part 230, these guidelines:\n- Establish environmental criteria for evaluating permit applications\n- Require avoidance and minimization of impacts\n- Mandate compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts\n- Prohibit permit issuance if: (1) a practicable alternative exists with less adverse impact, or (2) the discharge would cause or contribute to significant degradation of waters of the United States\n\n**2. Compensatory Mitigation Rule**\n\n40 C.F.R. § 230.93 (jointly promulgated with Corps at 33 C.F.R. § 332):\n- Establishes preference hierarchy: mitigation banks, in-lieu fee programs, then permittee-responsible mitigation\n- Requires functional and areal replacement ratios\n- Mandates long-term management and monitoring\n\n**3. EPA Enforcement and Oversight**\n\n- 40 C.F.R. Part 122: NPDES permit requirements (relevant for certain discharges)\n- 40 C.F.R. Part 233: State and tribal assumption of Section 404 programs\n- Section 404(c) veto authority guidelines at 40 C.F.R. Part 231\n\n### C. Definitional Rules for \"Waters of the United States\"\n\nThe definition of WOTUS has undergone multiple regulatory iterations:\n\n- **Pre-2015**: 1986/1988 regulations with case-by-case determinations\n- **2015 Clean Water Rule**: Broader definition (vacated and repealed)\n- **2019 Navigable Waters Protection Rule**: Narrower definition (rescinded)\n- **2023 Rule**: Post-*Sackett* rule conforming to Supreme Court precedent\n\n---\n\n## IV. KEY CASE LAW ON WETLANDS JURISDICTION\n\n### A. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985)\n\n**Holdings:**\n- Upheld Corps' jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters\n- Recognized the significant nexus between wetlands and traditional navigable waters\n- Deferred to the Corps' ecological judgment about adjacency\n\n**Significance:** Established the foundational principle that wetlands closely connected to traditional navigable waters fall within CWA jurisdiction.\n\n### B. Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC), 531 U.S. 159 (2001)\n\n**Holdings:**\n- Invalidated the \"Migratory Bird Rule\" that asserted jurisdiction based solely on migratory bird use\n- Limited jurisdiction over isolated, intrastate waters not adjacent to navigable waters\n- Applied the constitutional avoidance canon to prevent pushing outer boundaries of Commerce Clause\n\n**Significance:** First major limitation on WOTUS jurisdiction, establishing that mere wildlife use cannot independently establish federal jurisdiction.\n\n### C. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S. 715 (2006)\n\n**The Decision:**\nThe Court fractured into three opinions with no majority, creating substantial regulatory uncertainty:\n\n**1. Justice Scalia's Plurality (4 Justices):**\n- Jurisdiction limited to: (1) relatively permanent standing or continuously flowing bodies of water, and (2) wetlands with a continuous surface connection to such waters\n- Rejected jurisdiction over wetlands with only occasional or intermittent flow\n- Required physical contiguity, not mere hydrological connection\n\n**2. Justice Kennedy's Concurrence (Controlling):**\n- Established the \"significant nexus\" test\n- Jurisdiction exists if wetlands, \"either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters\"\n- Required more than speculative or insubstantial effects\n- Allowed case-by-case determinations based on ecological interconnection\n\n**3. Justice Stevens' Dissent (4 Justices):**\n- Would have deferred to Corps' regulations and affirmed broad jurisdiction\n\n**Significance:** The lower courts generally applied Justice Kennedy's significant nexus test as the controlling opinion under *Marks v. United States*, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), though some applied either test.\n\n### D. United States v. Donovan, 661 F.3d 174 (3d Cir. 2011)\n\n**Holdings:**\n- Applied significant nexus test to uphold jurisdiction over wetlands separated from tributary by berm\n- Emphasized ecological functions connecting wetlands to downstream navigable waters\n\n**Significance:** Illustrative of post-*Rapanos* circuit court approach applying Kennedy's test.\n\n### E. United States v. Cundiff, 555 F.3d 200 (6th Cir. 2009)\n\n**Holdings:**\n- Jurisdiction established under either Scalia's or Kennedy's *Rapanos* test\n- Upheld criminal conviction for unpermitted filling\n\n**Significance:** Demonstrated circuit court approach of applying both *Rapanos* tests disjunctively.\n\n---\n\n## V. SACKETT v. EPA: THE TRANSFORMATIVE 2023 DECISION\n\n### A. Case Background\n\n**Citation:** *Sackett v. EPA*, 143 S. Ct. 1322 (2023)\n\n**Facts:**\n- The Sacketts purchased property near Priest Lake, Idaho\n- They began placing fill material to construct a home\n- EPA issued a compliance order claiming the property contained WOTUS wetlands\n- The wetlands were separated from Priest Lake by a road and had no visible surface connection\n- Case reached Supreme Court on the merits after earlier procedural victory in *Sackett v. EPA*, 566 U.S. 120 (2012) (addressing finality of compliance orders)\n\n### B. The Supreme Court's Decision\n\n**Holding (9-0 on judgment; fractured on reasoning):**\n\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice Alito, rejected the significant nexus test and substantially narrowed federal wetlands jurisdiction.\n\n**1. Majority Opinion (5 Justices: Alito, Roberts, Thomas, Gorsuch, Barrett):**\n\n**Key Holdings:**\n\na) **\"Waters\" Must Be Waters:**\n   - The term \"waters\" refers to \"only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic features that are described in ordinary parlance as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes\"\n   - Wetlands are not themselves \"waters\" but may be regulated as adjacent to jurisdictional waters\n\nb) **The Continuous Surface Connection Requirement:**\n   - Wetlands are \"waters of the United States\" only if they have \"a continuous surface connection with bodies that are 'waters of the United States' in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between the two\"\n   - Must be \"indistinguishable\" from jurisdictional waters\n   - Adjacency alone is insufficient; requires physical contiguity\n\nc) **Rejection of Significant Nexus:**\n   - The significant nexus test improperly \"casts aside\" the ordinary meaning of \"waters\"\n   - Cannot expand beyond textual boundaries based on ecological considerations\n   - The test \"goes beyond adjudicating whether particular waters lie within 'the waters of the United States' and into the business of making policy\"\n\nd) **Textual Analysis:**\n   - Relied on statutory text, particularly the use of \"waters\" (plural) and \"navigable waters\"\n   - Emphasized that CWA regulates only \"the waters themselves\" not all land features that affect water quality\n   - Rejected expansive reading that would allow regulation of groundwater or land features based on hydrological connection\n\n**2. Concurring Opinions:**\n\n**Justice Thomas (concurring):**\n- Emphasized originalist interpretation\n- Questioned whether even the majority's test goes far enough in limiting federal jurisdiction\n\n**Justice Kavanaugh (concurring in judgment only, joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson):**\n- Agreed the Sackett property was not jurisdictional\n- Criticized majority for adopting continuous surface connection test\n- Would have retained Kennedy's significant nexus test from *Rapanos*\n- Argued the majority opinion improperly restricts jurisdiction over wetlands that affect downstream waters\n- Warned of \"significant repercussions\" including loss of protection for wetlands preventing flooding, filtering pollutants, and supporting ecosystems\n\n### C. Legal Analysis of Sackett's Reasoning\n\n**1. Statutory Interpretation Methodology:**\n\nThe majority employed a textualist approach:\n- Focused on ordinary meaning of \"waters\"\n- Rejected purpose-driven interpretation based on CWA's objective \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters\"\n- Limited deference to agency expertise in ecological matters\n\n**2. Rejection of Agency Deference:**\n\nWhile not explicitly overruling *Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984) (subsequently overruled in *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024)), the Court:\n- Applied a narrow interpretation despite regulatory history\n- Rejected EPA's and Corps' longstanding broader interpretations\n- Suggested major questions doctrine concerns with expansive jurisdiction\n\n**3. Treatment of Precedent:**\n\nThe Court:\n- Affirmed *Riverside Bayview* as correctly addressing truly adjacent wetlands\n- Distinguished *Riverside Bayview* as involving wetlands \"inseparably bound up\" with navigable waters\n- Overruled *Rapanos*'s significant nexus test (Kennedy concurrence)\n- Limited *SWANCC* to its specific holding\n\n### D. Application to the Sacketts' Property\n\nThe Court found:\n- The wetlands were separated from Priest Lake by a road\n- No continuous surface connection existed\n- A mere subsurface hydrological connection was insufficient\n- Therefore, the property was not WOTUS and not subject to CWA jurisdiction\n\n---\n\n## VI. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS OF SACKETT\n\n### A. Immediate Jurisdictional Impacts\n\n**1. Wetlands Excluded from Jurisdiction:**\n\nThe continuous surface connection requirement removes federal protection from:\n- Wetlands separated by natural berms, levees, or dunes\n- Wetlands divided by roads or infrastructure\n- Wetlands connected by culverts or subsurface flow only\n- \"Prairie potholes\" (depressional wetlands in the Great Plains)\n- Vernal pools without surface connections\n- Wetlands adjacent to intermittent or ephemeral streams\n- Wetlands with hydrological but not surface connections\n\n**2. Quantitative Estimates:**\n\nVarious analyses suggest:\n- Potentially millions of acres of wetlands losing federal protection\n- Significant impacts in Alaska, the Prairie Pothole region, and across agricultural areas\n- Reduced jurisdiction over headwater streams and their adjacent wetlands\n\n**3. Geographic Variation:**\n\nImpacts vary significantly by region:\n- **High Impact:** Alaska, Prairie states (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota), Florida\n- **Moderate Impact:** Coastal plain states with isolated wetland complexes\n- **Lower Impact:** Areas with well-defined river systems and continuous wetlands\n\n### B. Regulatory and Enforcement Consequences\n\n**1. Revised Agency Guidance:**\n\nPost-*Sackett*, EPA and Corps issued:\n- Revised jurisdictional determinations\n- Updated guidance on the continuous surface connection test\n- Amendments to approved jurisdictional determination forms\n- Clarifications on nationwide permit coverage\n\n**2. Nationwide Permit Program:**\n\nMany NWPs require verification that impacts are to WOTUS:\n- NWP 29 (residential development)\n- NWP 12 (utility lines)\n- NWP 39 (commercial development)\n\nReduced jurisdictional reach means:\n- Fewer projects requiring NWP verification\n- Less mitigation required for previously jurisdictional wetlands\n- Reduced transaction costs for some development\n\n**3. Individual Permits:**\n\n- Fewer projects triggering individual permit requirements\n- Reduced opportunities for public comment and EPA oversight\n- Decreased compensatory mitigation requirements\n\n**4. Enforcement Actions:**\n\n- Existing enforcement cases potentially invalidated if based on significant nexus\n- Reduced enforcement authority over historic violations\n- Difficulty prosecuting unpermitted fills in now non-jurisdictional wetlands\n\n### C. Environmental and Ecological Impacts\n\n**1. Loss of Wetland Functions:**\n\nWetlands removed from federal protection provided:\n- Flood attenuation and storage\n- Water quality improvement through filtration\n- Groundwater recharge\n- Habitat for wildlife, including endangered species\n- Carbon sequestration\n\n**2. Cumulative Effects:**\n\nThe *Sackett* decision:\n- Eliminates consideration of cumulative impacts across \"similarly situated\" wetlands\n- Removes protection for wetlands that collectively support downstream water quality\n- May accelerate wetland loss rates\n\n**3. Species Impacts:**\n\nEndangered and threatened species dependent on previously protected wetlands may face:\n- Habitat loss\n- Reduced Endangered Species Act protections (as CWA permits often triggered ESA consultation)",

    "response": "# MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** Securities Litigation Team\n**RE:** Analysis of Rule 10b-5 Private Securities Fraud Claims\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n\n---\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis memo analyzes the essential elements of a private securities fraud claim under Rule 10b-5, promulgated pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While Rule 10b-5 does not explicitly create a private right of action, the Supreme Court has recognized an implied private right for over 50 years, subject to increasingly stringent requirements developed through case law and statutory amendments.\n\n---\n\n## II. ELEMENTS OF A RULE 10b-5 PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION\n\nTo establish a private securities fraud claim under Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must prove:\n\n1. A material misrepresentation or omission\n2. Scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud)\n3. Connection with the purchase or sale of a security\n4. Reliance\n5. Economic loss\n6. Loss causation\n\n*Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano*, 563 U.S. 27, 37-38 (2011); *Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo*, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005).\n\n---\n\n## III. MATERIALITY AND THE FRAUD-ON-THE-MARKET THEORY\n\n### A. Materiality Standard\n\nA misrepresentation or omission is material if there is \"a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available.\" *Basic Inc. v. Levinson*, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988) (quoting *TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc.*, 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)).\n\nMateriality is inherently fact-specific and ordinarily a question for the jury. *Basic*, 485 U.S. at 236, 250. Even contingent or speculative information may be material; the Supreme Court rejected a bright-line \"agreement-in-principle\" test for merger negotiations, holding instead that materiality depends on \"a balancing of both the indicated probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of the company activity.\" *Id.* at 238 (applying *TSC Industries*).\n\n### B. Fraud-on-the-Market and Reliance\n\nIn *Basic*, the Supreme Court adopted the \"fraud-on-the-market\" theory, creating a rebuttable presumption of reliance in cases involving securities traded on efficient markets. 485 U.S. at 241-47. This presumption rests on the premise that in an efficient market, the price of a security reflects all publicly available information, and investors rely on the integrity of that price.\n\nTo invoke the presumption, plaintiffs must demonstrate:\n- The alleged misrepresentations were publicly known\n- The stock traded in an efficient market\n- The purchase occurred between the misrepresentation and corrective disclosure\n- Plaintiff relied on the integrity of the market price\n\n*Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.* (*Halliburton II*), 573 U.S. 258, 268 (2014).\n\n**Key Development:** In *Halliburton II*, the Supreme Court declined to overrule *Basic*'s fraud-on-the-market presumption but held that defendants may rebut the presumption at the class certification stage by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock price. 573 U.S. at 279-84. This \"price impact\" requirement provides defendants an opportunity to defeat the presumption before class certification.\n\n---\n\n## IV. SCIENTER REQUIREMENT\n\n### A. Supreme Court Standard\n\nScienter—\"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\"—is an essential element of a Rule 10b-5 claim. *Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder*, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976). The Supreme Court has left open whether recklessness satisfies scienter, *id.* at 194 n.12, though most circuits have concluded that it does.\n\n### B. Pleading Standards: The Tellabs Framework\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) requires plaintiffs to \"state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2).\n\nIn *Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.*, 551 U.S. 308 (2007), the Supreme Court established the controlling framework for evaluating scienter pleadings:\n\n**The Tellabs Standard:** A complaint survives only if \"a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\" *Id.* at 324.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Holistic Analysis:** Courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, not whether individual allegations, standing alone, support an inference of scienter. *Id.* at 322-23.\n\n2. **Comparative Plausibility:** Courts must weigh competing inferences, considering not just inferences favorable to plaintiff, but also plausible opposing inferences. *Id.* at 323-24.\n\n3. **Cognizance Standard:** The inference of scienter must be \"more than merely 'reasonable' or 'permissible'—it must be cogent and compelling.\" *Id.* at 314.\n\n### C. Post-Tellabs Circuit Court Developments\n\nCircuit courts have grappled with applying *Tellabs*' \"cogent and at least as compelling\" standard:\n\n**1. Second Circuit**\n\nThe Second Circuit applies *Tellabs* by requiring that scienter allegations be \"strong\"—that is, the inference must be \"cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.\" *ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd.*, 493 F.3d 87, 99 (2d Cir. 2007).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held that allegations of mere \"motive and opportunity\" are insufficient without particularized factual allegations. *Kalnit v. Eichler*, 264 F.3d 131, 138-39 (2d Cir. 2001). However, the circuit recognizes that scienter may be established through:\n\n- Evidence showing that defendants knew facts or had access to information contradicting public statements\n- Evidence of deliberately illegal behavior\n- Allegations of core operations that are \"of such prominence that it would be 'absurd' to suggest that management was unaware of the matter\"\n\n*Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley*, 776 F.3d 94, 106-07 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Arkansas Teacher Ret. Sys. v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc.*, 77 F.4th 74 (2d Cir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that even general corporate \"puffery\" may support liability if the statements were misleading in context and made with scienter, though plaintiffs must still adequately plead that defendants subjectively knew the statements were false when made.\n\n**2. Third Circuit**\n\nThe Third Circuit emphasizes that in the \"race\" between competing inferences, scienter must win by showing the fraudulent inference is \"at least as likely\" as any nonculpable explanation. *In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig.*, 311 F.3d 198, 216-17 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n**Recent Development:** In *City of Cambridge Ret. Sys. v. Altisource Asset Mgmt. Corp.*, 908 F.3d 872 (3d Cir. 2018), the Third Circuit emphasized that contemporaneous contradictory statements or conduct can establish scienter, but only where plaintiffs plausibly allege defendants were aware of the information undermining their public statements.\n\n**3. Sixth Circuit**\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has held that where defendants occupy important positions in a company and have regular access to relevant information, allegations that they knew or should have known certain facts may suffice. *Frank v. Dana Corp.*, 646 F.3d 954 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Tongue v. Sanofi*, 816 F.3d 199, 209-10 (6th Cir. 2016), the court clarified that core operations doctrine permits an inference of scienter only when the allegations make it \"highly unreasonable\" or \"essentially impossible\" that management lacked knowledge of the alleged problems.\n\n**4. Ninth Circuit**\n\nThe Ninth Circuit requires that scienter allegations be \"both reasonable and permit 'at least as compelling' an inference as any opposing inference.\" *Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp.*, 552 F.3d 981, 991 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\nThe circuit has been particularly receptive to confidential witness testimony, holding that while such testimony must be assessed as part of the holistic *Tellabs* analysis, detailed confidential witnesses may significantly bolster scienter allegations. *Police Ret. Sys. of St. Louis v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.*, 759 F.3d 1051, 1062 (9th Cir. 2014).\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc.*, 899 F.3d 988, 1008 (9th Cir. 2018), the Ninth Circuit held that courts must explicitly compare the competing inferences in their analysis and explain why the inference of scienter is at least as compelling as any nonculpable explanation.\n\n**5. Eleventh Circuit**\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit applies *Tellabs* by examining \"whether all of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.\" *Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc.*, 544 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir. 2008).\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Riverview Health Inst. LLC v. Med. Mut. of Ohio*, 601 F. App'x 862, 866 (11th Cir. 2015), the court clarified that the \"core operations\" inference is appropriately relied upon only when the nature of the relevant operations and the defendant's position make it \"highly likely\" they had actual knowledge of the misstatement.\n\n---\n\n## V. LOSS CAUSATION\n\n### A. The Dura Pharmaceuticals Standard\n\nIn *Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo*, 544 U.S. 336 (2005), the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs must prove \"proximate cause\": that the defendant's misrepresentation directly caused the economic loss.\n\n**Key Holdings:**\n\n1. **Mere Purchase at Inflated Price Insufficient:** The Court rejected the argument that purchasing stock at an artificially inflated price, by itself, constitutes recoverable loss. *Id.* at 342-43.\n\n2. **Revelation of Truth Required:** Loss causation typically requires proof that the loss occurred when \"the relevant truth begins to leak out\" or is otherwise revealed to the market. *Id.* at 344-45, 347.\n\n3. **Pleading Requirement:** At the pleading stage, plaintiffs must \"provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.\" *Id.* at 347.\n\n### B. Application of the Dura Standard\n\nCourts have interpreted *Dura* to require that losses result from the materialization of the concealed risk, not from other market factors:\n\n**\"Materialization of the Risk\" Test:** The loss must stem from the risk that made the misrepresentation materially misleading in the first place. *Lloyd v. CVB Fin. Corp.*, 811 F.3d 1200, 1208 (9th Cir. 2016).\n\n**Corrective Disclosure:** Plaintiffs must typically identify a \"corrective disclosure\"—a release of information revealing the truth that was previously concealed or misstated. *Lormand v. US Unwired, Inc.*, 565 F.3d 228, 257 (5th Cir. 2009).\n\n### C. Recent Circuit Court Developments on Loss Causation\n\n**1. Second Circuit**\n\nIn *IBEW Local Union No. 58 Pension Tr. Fund & Annuity Fund v. Royal Bank of Scot. Grp., PLC*, 783 F.3d 383 (2d Cir. 2015), the Second Circuit held that loss causation may be established through a \"leakage\" theory where the truth emerges gradually through a series of partial disclosures, not just a single dramatic revelation.\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Waggoner v. Barclays PLC*, 875 F.3d 79, 99-100 (2d Cir. 2017), the court clarified that where multiple disclosures occur, plaintiffs must demonstrate which disclosures actually revealed the alleged fraud, distinguishing between disclosures of new negative information and those revealing prior misstatements.\n\n**2. Third Circuit**\n\nThe Third Circuit requires a \"proximate causal relation\" between misrepresentation and investment loss. *McCabe v. Ernst & Young, LLP*, 494 F.3d 418, 425 (3d Cir. 2007). The court has emphasized that loss causation requires more than temporal proximity between disclosure and price decline; plaintiffs must show the decline resulted from revelation of the fraud, not other factors.\n\n**3. Fifth Circuit**\n\nIn *Lormand v. US Unwired, Inc.*, 565 F.3d 228, 257 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiffs must prove the fraud proximately caused the economic loss and that the market's reaction to the corrective disclosure must be analyzed to determine whether the loss related to the fraud or other factors.\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Pursell v. Farmers Grp., Inc.*, 868 F.3d 561 (5th Cir. 2017) (applying Ninth Circuit law), the court recognized that even where a company discloses reasons for poor performance, if those reasons are themselves false and conceal the true fraud, subsequent revelation of the true reason can establish loss causation.\n\n**4. Ninth Circuit**\n\nThe Ninth Circuit follows a \"materialization of the risk\" approach, requiring that \"the loss [be] caused by the materialization of the concealed risk.\" *Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colls., Inc.*, 540 F.3d 1049, 1063 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n**Recent Development:** In *Lloyd v. CVB Fin. Corp.*, 811 F.3d 1200 (9th Cir. 2016), the Ninth Circuit clarified that where defendants misrepresent business practices, loss causation requires showing that losses resulted from the undisclosed unlawful conduct, not merely from market discovery of previously hidden lawful information.\n\n---\n\n## VI. ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### A. Heightened Pleading Under the PSLRA\n\nThe PSLRA imposes additional pleading requirements beyond Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b):\n\n1. **Particularity for Misleading Statements:** Plaintiffs must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, ... all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1).\n\n2. **Falsity at Time Made:** Plaintiffs must adequately allege that statements were false when made, not merely that they later proved inaccurate. *Omnicom Grp., Inc. v. City of Royal Oak Ret. Sys.*, 551 U.S. 312 (2007) (per curiam).\n\n### B. Statutory Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThe PSLRA provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements accompanied by \"meaningful cautionary statements\" or made without actual knowledge of falsity. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c). Circuit courts differ on what constitutes \"meaningful\" cautionary language, with some requiring specific warnings tailored to the particular risks concealed by defendants.\n\n### C.

    "response": "# LEGAL MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** File\n**FROM:** [Attorney]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Standards for Modifying Child Custody Orders in Illinois\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE\n\nWhat legal standards and evidentiary requirements must be satisfied to modify an existing child custody order (allocation of parental responsibilities) in Illinois?\n\n---\n\n## BRIEF ANSWER\n\nUnder 750 ILCS 5/610.5, modification of parental responsibility allocation requires a two-part analysis. First, the petitioning party must demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances that warrants modification. Second, the court must find that modification serves the child's best interests. The threshold showing varies based on the type of modification sought and the time elapsed since the original order. Illinois courts apply heightened standards when modifications involve significant parenting time changes or relocation to ensure stability for children while remaining flexible enough to accommodate genuine changes in family circumstances.\n\n---\n\n## APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n### I. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: 750 ILCS 5/610.5\n\nThe Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (IMDMA), specifically Section 610.5, governs modification of parental responsibility allocation orders. This statute was substantially revised in 2016 as part of Illinois's shift from \"custody\" terminology to \"allocation of parental responsibilities.\"\n\n#### A. General Modification Standard (750 ILCS 5/610.5(a))\n\nThe statute establishes that the court may modify a parenting plan or allocation judgment when:\n\n1. **Changed circumstances have occurred** since the entry of the last order; and\n2. **Modification is necessary** to serve the child's best interests.\n\nThe party seeking modification bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. *In re Marriage of Eckert*, 119 Ill. 2d 316, 518 N.E.2d 1041 (1988).\n\n#### B. Two-Year Restriction (750 ILCS 5/610.5(c))\n\nAbsent specific circumstances, a party generally cannot file a modification petition within two years of the original judgment unless:\n\n1. The child's physical, mental, moral, or emotional health is seriously endangered; or\n2. Both parties agree to the modification.\n\nThis restriction promotes stability and discourages repetitive litigation. *In re Marriage of Schippers*, 287 Ill. App. 3d 821, 678 N.E.2d 1310 (2nd Dist. 1997).\n\n#### C. Affidavit Requirement (750 ILCS 5/610.5(b))\n\nAny petition for modification must be supported by an affidavit establishing:\n\n- Specific facts showing changed circumstances;\n- How the change affects the child's best interests; and\n- Why modification is necessary.\n\nConclusory allegations are insufficient. *In re Marriage of Fatkin*, 232 Ill. App. 3d 742, 597 N.E.2d 1297 (1st Dist. 1992).\n\n---\n\n## II. SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n### A. General Definition and Scope\n\nA \"substantial change in circumstances\" requires proof of meaningful changes in conditions affecting the child's welfare that have occurred since the entry of the existing order. The change must be:\n\n1. **Substantial** (not minor or trivial);\n2. **Material** (relevant to parenting capacity or the child's needs);\n3. **Unanticipated** at the time of the original order; and\n4. **Continuous** rather than temporary.\n\n*In re Marriage of Eckert*, 119 Ill. 2d 316, 518 N.E.2d 1041 (1988); *In re Marriage of Zarda*, 2020 IL App (2d) 190035, 158 N.E.3d 121.\n\n### B. Types of Changed Circumstances Recognized by Courts\n\nIllinois appellate courts have identified various circumstances that may constitute substantial changes:\n\n#### 1. **Parental Fitness and Conduct**\n\n**Physical or mental health deterioration**: A parent's declining physical or mental health may constitute changed circumstances if it affects parenting ability. *In re Marriage of Miller*, 387 Ill. App. 3d 1116, 901 N.E.2d 1232 (4th Dist. 2009) (mother's psychiatric hospitalization and inability to care for herself).\n\n**Substance abuse**: New evidence of drug or alcohol abuse, or relapse after treatment, constitutes changed circumstances. *In re Marriage of Juntikka*, 2015 IL App (2d) 140760, 43 N.E.3d 277 (father's continued alcohol abuse and DUIs).\n\n**Domestic violence**: Post-decree incidents of domestic violence represent substantial changes warranting modification. *In re Marriage of Hasaballa*, 2021 IL App (1st) 190884, 189 N.E.3d 1036.\n\n**Criminal conduct**: Conviction of crimes, particularly those involving violence, drugs, or moral turpitude, may support modification. *In re Marriage of Bergschneider*, 2019 IL App (4th) 180145, 135 N.E.3d 1145.\n\n#### 2. **Child's Needs and Development**\n\n**Age and maturity**: As children mature, their educational, social, and emotional needs change. *In re Marriage of Polsky*, 387 Ill. App. 3d 126, 899 N.E.2d 454 (1st Dist. 2008) (child's entrance into school age).\n\n**Medical or psychological needs**: Development of special medical or psychological needs may require modification. *In re Marriage of Porter*, 401 Ill. App. 3d 848, 929 N.E.2d 1221 (2nd Dist. 2010).\n\n**Child's preference**: While not alone sufficient, a mature child's reasoned preference may constitute one factor in changed circumstances. *In re Marriage of Winter*, 2017 IL App (1st) 152428, 77 N.E.3d 1261 (considering 14-year-old's preference alongside other factors).\n\n#### 3. **Relocation**\n\n**Geographic distance**: A parent's relocation that significantly impacts the existing parenting schedule may constitute changed circumstances. *In re Marriage of Whitmore*, 2013 IL App (5th) 120331, 2 N.E.3d 385.\n\nNote: Relocation cases are also governed by specific statutory provisions in 750 ILCS 5/609.2, which creates a distinct framework.\n\n#### 4. **Changes in Living Circumstances**\n\n**Remarriage or new relationships**: Standing alone, remarriage is typically insufficient, but may be relevant if it affects the child's environment. *In re Marriage of Bratcher*, 2015 IL App (5th) 140376, 43 N.E.3d 873.\n\n**Housing instability**: Frequent moves, inadequate housing, or unstable living conditions. *In re Marriage of Brown*, 348 Ill. App. 3d 327, 808 N.E.2d 930 (1st Dist. 2004).\n\n#### 5. **Interference with Parenting Time**\n\n**Persistent denial of access**: Systematic denial or interference with the other parent's parenting time constitutes changed circumstances. *In re Marriage of Johnson*, 2018 IL App (3d) 160507, 99 N.E.3d 1189.\n\n**Alienation**: Conduct calculated to alienate the child from the other parent. *In re Marriage of Bates*, 212 Ill. 2d 489, 819 N.E.2d 714 (2004) (recognizing parental alienation as factor).\n\n### C. Insufficient Grounds for Changed Circumstances\n\nCourts have consistently held that certain circumstances do not, by themselves, constitute substantial changes:\n\n1. **Normal maturation of children**: Ordinary developmental changes. *In re Marriage of Majauskas*, 282 Ill. App. 3d 1023, 669 N.E.2d 718 (1st Dist. 1996).\n\n2. **Financial improvement**: Increased income alone is generally insufficient. *In re Marriage of Guerra*, 2011 IL App (1st) 093949, 962 N.E.2d 879.\n\n3. **Remarriage alone**: Without showing impact on child. *In re Marriage of Bratcher*, 2015 IL App (5th) 140376, 43 N.E.3d 873.\n\n4. **Change in work schedule**: Unless it substantially affects parenting capacity. *In re Marriage of Brainard*, 2012 IL App (4th) 110734, 967 N.E.2d 1268.\n\n5. **Frustration with co-parenting**: General dissatisfaction without specific harmful conduct. *In re Marriage of Fatkin*, 232 Ill. App. 3d 742, 597 N.E.2d 1297 (1st Dist. 1992).\n\n### D. Burden of Proof\n\nThe petitioning party bears the burden of proving changed circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. *In re Marriage of Eckert*, 119 Ill. 2d 316, 518 N.E.2d 1041 (1988).\n\nCourts employ a **threshold analysis**: the party must first establish changed circumstances before the court will proceed to analyze the child's best interests. *In re Marriage of Zarda*, 2020 IL App (2d) 190035, 158 N.E.3d 121.\n\n---\n\n## III. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD STANDARD\n\n### A. Statutory Factors (750 ILCS 5/602.7)\n\nOnce changed circumstances are established, the court must determine whether modification serves the child's best interests under Section 602.7, which includes:\n\n1. **The child's wishes**, considering the child's maturity and ability to express reasoned preferences;\n\n2. **The child's adjustment** to home, school, and community;\n\n3. **Mental and physical health** of all individuals involved;\n\n4. **The parents' willingness to facilitate** the relationship between the child and other parent;\n\n5. **Physical violence or threat of physical violence** by a parent directed against the child or other household member;\n\n6. **Occurrence of ongoing abuse** as defined in the Illinois Domestic Violence Act;\n\n7. **Willingness and ability of each parent** to place the child's needs before their own;\n\n8. **The amount of time** each parent spent performing caretaking functions in the 24 months preceding the filing;\n\n9. **Any other factor** the court deems relevant.\n\n*In re Marriage of Bates*, 212 Ill. 2d 489, 819 N.E.2d 714 (2004); *In re Marriage of Gosnell*, 2016 IL App (4th) 150826, 63 N.E.3d 976.\n\n### B. Application in Modification Context\n\n#### 1. **Stability and Continuity**\n\nIllinois courts recognize a strong preference for stability in children's lives. Courts are cautious about disrupting established arrangements unless compelling reasons exist. *In re Marriage of Polsky*, 387 Ill. App. 3d 126, 899 N.E.2d 454 (1st Dist. 2008).\n\nHowever, stability does not mean immutability. As the Illinois Supreme Court noted in *Eckert*, maintaining an outdated arrangement that no longer serves the child's needs does not promote genuine stability.\n\n#### 2. **Cooperation and Communication**\n\nA parent's willingness to facilitate the child's relationship with the other parent is a critical best interests factor. Courts may modify allocation when one parent consistently undermines the other's relationship with the child. *In re Marriage of Johnson*, 2018 IL App (3d) 160507, 99 N.E.3d 1189.\n\n#### 3. **Child's Expressed Preference**\n\nWhile not determinative, Illinois courts afford significant weight to a mature child's reasoned preference. The weight increases with the child's age and maturity. *In re Marriage of Winter*, 2017 IL App (1st) 152428, 77 N.E.3d 1261 (court properly considered 14-year-old's desires).\n\nCourts may, but are not required to, interview children in camera. 750 ILCS 5/602.10(b).\n\n#### 4. **Role of Guardian ad Litem**\n\nCourts frequently appoint guardians ad litem or child representatives in contested modification cases to investigate and report on the child's best interests. 750 ILCS 5/506. The GAL's recommendations, while not binding, are often given substantial weight. *In re Marriage of Heller*, 2019 IL App (2d) 180megyears, 130 N.E.3d 596.\n\n---\n\n## IV. HEIGHTENED STANDARDS FOR SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS\n\n### A. Major Parenting Time Reallocation\n\nWhen a modification would significantly alter the existing parenting time schedule, courts apply heightened scrutiny. The party seeking modification must demonstrate:\n\n1. Clear evidence of changed circumstances;\n2. That the existing arrangement is harmful or no longer workable; and\n3. That modification substantially benefits the child, not merely the requesting parent.\n\n*In re Marriage of Polsky*, 387 Ill. App. 3d 126, 899 N.E.2d 454 (1st Dist. 2008).\n\n### B. Change of Primary Residence\n\nChanging which parent has the majority of parenting time (primary residence) requires the most compelling showing. Courts require:\n\n1. **Substantial and continuing changed circumstances**;\n2. **Clear benefit to the child** from the change; and\n3. Evidence that the current situation is **detrimental** or that the proposed change offers **significantly better** circumstances.\n\n*In re Marriage of Miller*, 387 Ill. App. 3d 1116, 901 N.E.2d 1232 (4th Dist. 2009); *In re Marriage of Zarda*, 2020 IL App (2d) 190035, 158 N.E.3d 121.\n\nThe Fourth District articulated this heightened standard in *Miller*: \"To deprive a parent of the primary residential parent status requires more than the minimum showing of changed circumstances; there must be a showing that the present environment is detrimental to the child or that the moving parent presents a better situation for the child.\"\n\n---\n\n## V. PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### A. Pleading Requirements\n\nThe modification petition must:\n\n1. Include a detailed affidavit of changed circumstances (750 ILCS 5/610.5(b));\n2. Specify the requested modifications;\n3. Demonstrate compliance with the two-year restriction or applicable exceptions;\n4. Include required disclosures about pending proceedings and other relevant matters (750 ILCS 5/602.8).\n\n### B. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nIf the petition and affidavit establish a prima facie case of changed circumstances, the court must conduct an evidentiary hearing. *In re Marriage of Fatkin*, 232 Ill. App. 3d 742, 597 N.E.2d 1297 (1st Dist. 1992).\n\nThe hearing may include:\n- Testimony from parents, witnesses, and experts;\n- Documentary evidence;\n- Guardian ad litem reports;\n- In camera interviews with children (discretionary);\n- Psychological evaluations (if ordered).\n\n### C. Standard of Review on Appeal\n\nTrial courts have broad discretion in modification determinations. Appellate courts review these decisions for abuse of discretion. *In re Marriage of Eckert*, 119 Ill. 2d 316, 518 N.E.2d 1041 (1988).\n\nAn abuse of discretion occurs only when no reasonable person would agree with the trial court's decision or when the decision rests on an error of law. *In re Marriage of Bates*, 212 Ill. 2d 489, 819 N.E.2d 714 (2004).\n\nFindings of fact will not be disturbed unless against the manifest weight of the evidence. *In re Marriage of Hasaballa*, 2021 IL App (1st) 190884, 189 N.E.3d 1036.\n\n---\n\n## VI. KEY ILLINOIS APPELLATE DECISIONS\n\n### A. Leading Supreme Court Decisions\n\n#### 1. *In re Marriage of Eckert*, 119 Ill. 2d 316, 518 N.E.2d 1041 (1988)\n\n**Holding**: Established that modification requires both changed circumstances and a finding that modification serves the child's best interests. Created the two-part threshold analysis.\n\n**Significance**: Seminal case providing the foundational framework for all subsequent modification cases. Clarified that the burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence.\n\n**Key Language**: \"The public policy of Illinois",

    "response": "# MEMORANDUM\n\n**TO:** Immigration Law Team\n**FROM:** [Author]\n**DATE:** [Current Date]\n**RE:** Legal Standards for Asylum Claims Based on Persecution Due to Membership in a Particular Social Group\n\n---\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis memorandum analyzes the legal framework for asylum claims based on membership in a particular social group (PSG), one of the five protected grounds under U.S. asylum law. This area has undergone significant evolution, particularly following *Matter of A-B-*, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), which substantially narrowed the interpretation of cognizable social groups.\n\n---\n\n## II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. Immigration and Nationality Act\n\nThe statutory basis for PSG-based asylum claims derives from:\n\n**INA § 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A)** defines \"refugee\" as a person unable or unwilling to return to their country \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"\n\n**INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i)** establishes that the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish refugee status, requiring demonstration that:\n- The applicant suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution\n- The persecution is \"on account of\" one of the five protected grounds\n- The government is unable or unwilling to protect the applicant\n\n**INA § 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A)** grants the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security discretionary authority to grant asylum to refugees.\n\n---\n\n## III. BIA FRAMEWORK FOR PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP\n\n### A. Foundational BIA Decisions\n\n**1. Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211 (BIA 1985)**\n\nThis seminal decision established the foundational test for PSG:\n- A PSG must share a \"common, immutable characteristic\"\n- The characteristic must be one that members either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their identity or conscience\n- Examples include \"sex, color, kinship ties, or past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership\"\n\n**2. Matter of C-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 951 (BIA 2006)**\n\nThe BIA added two additional requirements:\n- **Particularity**: The group must be defined with sufficient specificity that it would be recognized as a discrete class of persons\n- **Social distinction**: The group must be perceived as a group by society\n\nThe BIA noted that \"the fact that a group is defined by past events that cannot be changed does not end the inquiry.\"\n\n**3. Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014)**\n\nClarified the \"social distinction\" requirement:\n- The group must be perceived as a group by the society in question, not just by the persecutor\n- \"[T]he particular social group must exist independently of the persecution suffered by an individual member or members of the group\"\n- Recognized \"former gang members in El Salvador who have renounced their gang membership\" as a cognizable PSG (though ultimately denying relief on other grounds)\n\n**4. Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014)**\n\nCompanion case to *M-E-V-G-*:\n- Recognized \"married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship\" as a cognizable PSG\n- Emphasized that \"the focus is on how the group is perceived by society, rather than how the alleged persecutor perceives the group\"\n\n### B. Matter of A-B- and Its Aftermath\n\n**Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018)**\n\nThen-Attorney General Sessions significantly restricted PSG claims:\n\n**Holdings:**\n- Overruled *Matter of A-R-C-G-*, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014), which had recognized \"married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship\" as a PSG\n- Found that claims involving \"private criminal activity\" generally do not qualify for asylum\n- Stated that \"generally\" domestic violence and gang violence victims cannot establish PSG-based claims\n- Emphasized that asylum is for \"individuals who have suffered or fear persecution by a government or by forces the government is unwilling or unable to control\" but expressed skepticism about private actor persecution\n\n**Key Restrictive Language:**\n- \"[T]he asylum statute is not a general hardship statute\"\n- \"An applicant seeking to establish persecution based on violent conduct of a private actor must show more than the government's difficulty controlling private behavior\"\n- \"[T]he mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes—such as domestic violence or gang violence—or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim\"\n\n**5. Matter of A-C-A-A-, 28 I&N Dec. 84 (BIA 2020)**\n\nPost-*A-B-* BIA decision that attempted to clarify the framework:\n- Reaffirmed that the three-prong test from *Acosta*, *C-A-*, and *M-E-V-G-* remains controlling for PSG analysis\n- Emphasized that each case must be evaluated on its specific facts\n- While *A-B-* expressed skepticism, it \"did not categorically preclude\" domestic violence-based PSG claims\n\n**6. Matter of L-E-A-, 28 I&N Dec. 304 (BIA 2021)**\n\nSignificant decision addressing family-based PSGs:\n- Recognized that nuclear family can constitute a PSG\n- Held that \"the respondent's nuclear family is a particular social group\" satisfying all three prongs (immutability, particularity, and social distinction)\n- Found that family-based PSGs are \"easily defined with particularity\" and \"readily identifiable and recognized by others in society\"\n- Emphasized that families are \"prototypical example[s] of a social group\" that satisfy the immutability requirement\n- However, remanded to determine nexus between persecution and PSG membership\n\n---\n\n## IV. FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT INTERPRETATIONS\n\n### A. Defining Particular Social Group\n\n**Perdomo v. Holder, 611 F.3d 662 (9th Cir. 2010)**\n- PSG must be \"defined by characteristics that are immutable or fundamental to identity, conscience, or the exercise of human rights\"\n- The characteristic cannot be \"too loosely defined to meet the requirement of particularity\"\n\n**Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. Attorney General, 663 F.3d 582 (3d Cir. 2011)**\n- Adopted the \"ejusdem generis\" canon of construction—PSG should be interpreted consistently with the other four grounds (race, religion, nationality, political opinion)\n- Recognized \"Salvadoran youth who have been actively recruited by gangs but who have refused to join because they oppose the gangs\" as a cognizable PSG\n\n**Sanchez-Trujillo v. INS, 801 F.2d 1571 (9th Cir. 1986)**\n- Early case requiring \"voluntary associational relationship\" (later rejected by most circuits)\n- Required members to be \"closely affiliated with each other\" and \"cooperate in some way\"\n\n**Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117 (4th Cir. 2011)**\n- Recognized \"family\" as a cognizable PSG\n- Found that family membership \"is typically an immutable characteristic that is either impossible to change or should not be required to be changed\"\n\n### B. Post-Matter of A-B- Circuit Court Decisions\n\n**Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96 (D.D.C. 2018)**\n- District court vacated *Matter of A-B-* for procedural violations (failure to provide notice and comment)\n- However, this decision was later vacated as moot after case became moot: *Grace v. Barr*, 965 F.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020)\n\n**Reyes v. Barr, 964 F.3d 1164 (11th Cir. 2020)**\n- Post-*A-B-* decision examining domestic violence claim\n- Held that BIA failed to adequately address whether proposed PSG of \"Honduran women in domestic relationships who are unable to leave\" satisfied the particularity and social distinction requirements\n- Noted that *A-B-* did not categorically bar domestic violence claims but imposed heightened scrutiny\n\n**Menjivar v. Barr, No. 18-72891 (9th Cir. Dec. 27, 2019)** (unpublished)\n- Remanded case where IJ denied claim based on *A-B-* without properly analyzing the specific PSG\n- Emphasized that fact-specific analysis is still required post-*A-B-*\n\n**Urbina-Mejia v. Barr, 979 F.3d 281 (4th Cir. 2020)**\n- Recognized \"Honduran women unable to leave a domestic relationship\" as a cognizable PSG\n- Found that *A-B-* \"did not hold that domestic violence victims may never successfully bring asylum claims\"\n- Emphasized that private violence can form the basis of asylum where government is unable or unwilling to protect\n\n**Ucelo-Gomez v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 70 (2d Cir. 2007)**\n- Pre-*A-B-* but still influential: recognized \"affluent Guatemalans\" as PSG\n- Applied *Acosta* immutability test\n\n**Marikasi v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 281 (6th Cir. 2016)**\n- Recognized \"Kenyan women who have not undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) and oppose the practice\" as a cognizable PSG\n- Found this group satisfied immutability, particularity, and social distinction requirements\n\n### C. Circuit Splits and Variations\n\n**Social Distinction Requirement:**\n\n- **9th Circuit**: In *Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder*, 707 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc), held that BIA's social distinction requirement was not arbitrary and capricious\n- **7th Circuit**: In *Gatimi v. Holder*, 578 F.3d 611 (7th Cir. 2009), expressed skepticism about the social distinction requirement but ultimately applied it\n\n**Family-Based PSGs:**\n\n- **Multiple circuits** have recognized family as a PSG: *Crespin-Valladares* (4th Cir.), *Ayala v. Attorney General*, 605 F.3d 941 (11th Cir. 2010), *Al-Ghorbani v. Holder*, 585 F.3d 980 (6th Cir. 2009)\n- Generally accepted where family has been specifically targeted\n\n---\n\n## V. CONTEMPORARY PSG ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. Three-Prong Test (Post-A-B-)\n\nTo establish a cognizable PSG, applicants must demonstrate:\n\n**1. Immutability** (*Matter of Acosta*)\n- Members share a common characteristic that is either:\n  - Immutable (cannot be changed), OR\n  - So fundamental to identity or conscience that members should not be required to change it\n\n**2. Particularity** (*Matter of C-A-*)\n- The group must be defined with sufficient specificity\n- Must have \"clear boundaries\" that would allow immigration judges to determine who falls within the group\n- Cannot be defined \"circularly\" by the persecution itself\n- Overly broad formulations fail this test\n\n**3. Social Distinction** (*Matter of M-E-V-G-*)\n- The proposed group must be recognized and understood to be a societal faction by the society in question\n- Focus is on how society perceives the group, not solely on persecutor's perception\n- Must exist independently of the harm feared\n- Can be demonstrated through evidence such as country conditions reports, expert testimony, documentary evidence\n\n### B. Additional Requirements\n\nBeyond establishing a cognizable PSG, applicants must prove:\n\n**Nexus** (*INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i)*)\n- Persecution must be \"on account of\" PSG membership\n- Can be established by showing PSG membership was \"one central reason\" for persecution (INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i), added by REAL ID Act of 2005)\n- In *Matter of A-B-*, the AG emphasized heightened nexus scrutiny for private actor persecution\n\n**Government Inability or Unwillingness to Protect**\n- Under *A-B-*, applicants must show \"more than the government's difficulty controlling private behavior\"\n- Must demonstrate government condoned the behavior or was completely helpless to protect\n- Consider whether adequate internal relocation alternative exists\n\n---\n\n## VI. CATEGORIES OF PSG CLAIMS POST-A-B-\n\n### A. More Likely to Succeed\n\n**1. Family-Based PSGs**\n- *Matter of L-E-A-* provides strong support\n- Courts across circuits have recognized family as prototypical PSG\n- Key: Must show family specifically targeted, not random criminal violence\n\n**2. FGM Opposition**\n- Strong support in case law (*Marikasi*)\n- Asylum Supplemental Regulations specifically recognize this group (8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii))\n\n**3. Former Gang Members Who Have Renounced Membership**\n- Recognized in *Matter of M-E-V-G-*\n- Must show attempted recruitment, clear renunciation, and inability to change status\n\n**4. LGBTQ+ Individuals**\n- Generally accepted as immutable characteristic\n- Strong support across circuits when country conditions demonstrate societal recognition and persecution\n\n### B. More Difficult Post-A-B-\n\n**1. Domestic Violence Victims**\n- *Matter of A-B-* created significant obstacles\n- Must carefully articulate PSG with particularity and social distinction\n- Cannot define group solely by victimization\n- Some circuits (*Urbina-Mejia*) have pushed back on categorical exclusion\n\n**2. Gang Violence Victims**\n- *A-B-* expressed skepticism about \"private criminal activity\"\n- Must demonstrate government complicity or complete inability to protect\n- Younger applicants who are recruitment targets may have stronger claims\n\n**3. Witnesses to Crime/Informants**\n- Mixed results\n- Stronger when combined with other immutable characteristics\n- Nexus often difficult to establish\n\n---\n\n## VII. DRAFTING CONSIDERATIONS FOR PSG CLAIMS\n\n### A. Formulation of the PSG\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Circular definitions (e.g., \"Salvadoran women who are victims of domestic violence\")\n- Overly broad formulations (e.g., \"young men in El Salvador\")\n- Defining group solely by persecution feared\n- Vague or subjective characteristics\n\n**Prefer:**\n- Specific, narrow formulations with clear boundaries\n- Emphasize immutable or fundamental characteristics\n- Include relevant country or regional specificity\n- Articulate characteristics that exist independent of harm\n\n**Example Formulations:**\n\n*Weak*: \"Women in Guatemala who are victims of domestic violence\"\n- Defined by persecution itself\n- Lacks particularity\n\n*Stronger*: \"Indigenous Mayan women in Guatemala who are in domestic relationships and unable to leave due to economic dependence, lack of family support, and societal norms\"\n- More particular boundaries\n- Incorporates immutable characteristics (ethnicity, gender)\n- References societal factors supporting social distinction\n\n### B. Evidence Requirements\n\n**To Establish PSG:**\n- Country conditions reports from State Department, UNHCR, human rights organizations\n- Expert testimony on societal perception and recognition of group\n- Evidence of laws, cultural practices, social structures relevant to group identity\n- Statistical evidence of group's treatment in society\n\n**To Establish Nexus:**\n- Direct evidence of persecutor's motivation\n- Circumstantial evidence where direct evidence unavailable\n- Evidence that persecutor targeted applicant because of group membership\n- Comparative evidence showing similarly situated individuals outside group not persecuted\n\n**To Establish Government Acquiescence:**\n- Evidence of attempts to seek protection that failed\n- Country conditions reports on police corruption, ineffectiveness\n- Evidence of discriminatory enforcement of laws\n- Evidence that government condones or is complicit in persecution\n\n---\n\n## VIII. IMPACT OF A-B- BY JURISDICTION\n\n### A. Circuits More Restrictive\n\n**11th Circuit**: Has generally applied",
