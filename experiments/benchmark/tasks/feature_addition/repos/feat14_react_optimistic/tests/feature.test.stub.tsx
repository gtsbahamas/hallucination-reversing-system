/**
 * STUB: Feature tests for Optimistic UI Updates.
 *
 * TODO: Implement these tests when the base repo is built.
 *
 * Tests should verify:
 * - Mutation updates UI immediately before server response
 * - On server success, UI stays updated
 * - On server error, UI rolls back to previous state
 * - Error toast is shown on rollback
 * - Concurrent optimistic updates don't interfere
 * - Loading state is shown during server confirmation
