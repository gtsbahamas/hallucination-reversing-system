STUB: Feature tests for Cursor-Based Pagination.

TODO: Implement these tests when the base repo is built.

Tests should verify:
- Response includes next_cursor and prev_cursor
- Cursor navigates to correct page
- page_size parameter works (max 100)
- Stable ordering with concurrent inserts
- Cursor is opaque (base64-encoded)
