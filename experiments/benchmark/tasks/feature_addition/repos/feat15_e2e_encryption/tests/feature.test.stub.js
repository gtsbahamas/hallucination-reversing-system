/**
 * STUB: Feature tests for End-to-End Encryption.
 *
 * TODO: Implement these tests when the base repo is built.
 *
 * Tests should verify:
 * - Key pair generated per user (Web Crypto API)
 * - Public key published/exchanged correctly
 * - Message encrypted with recipient's public key
 * - Message decrypted with own private key
 * - Key exchange protocol on first message
 * - Private key stored encrypted in localStorage
 * - Server never sees plaintext message content
