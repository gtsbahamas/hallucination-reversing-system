Dear [CLIENT CONTACT NAME],

Thank you for selecting LUCID to perform an AI Code Quality Audit of your codebase. This letter confirms the terms of our engagement.

---

## 1. SCOPE

LUCID will perform a Spotlight-tier AI Code Quality Audit of the following repository:

**Repository:** [REPO NAME / URL]
**Language(s):** [PRIMARY LANGUAGES]
**Approximate Size:** [LOC or FILES]

The audit will include:

- **AI Code Footprint Analysis** -- Identification and quantification of AI-generated code.
- **Formal Verification** -- Application of LUCID's patent-pending verification methodology (U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/980,048) to assess semantic correctness. This uses deterministic formal methods, not AI-based code review.
- **Security Assessment** -- Identification of AI-introduced vulnerabilities, mapped to CWE identifiers.
- **Hallucination Pattern Detection** -- Identification of missing implementations, incorrect logic, placeholder data, and authentication bypasses.
- **Quality Scoring** -- Overall and per-module quality score on a 0-100 scale.
- **Top Findings Summary** -- Prioritized list of the most significant findings with remediation guidance.

## 7. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
