      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation contains prose/explanation text that isn't properly commented out, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 2-14 (the explanation text between the docstring and the actual function implementation)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or properly comment out all the explanatory text that appears after the docstring but before the function implementation.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete lines containing \"Looking at this problem...\", \"Key insight:...\", \"For each pair...\", \"Let me trace through...\", and all the example traces\n- Keep only the actual Python code (the function implementation starting from `changes = 0`)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse plain English text as Python code. The text \"For each pair that doesn't match...\" contains an unmatched parenthesis that Python's parser encounters. By removing this explanatory text (which should either be in comments with `#` or not present at all), the code will be syntactically valid.\n\n**Result**: The function implementation itself is correct - it properly counts mismatched pairs by comparing elements from both ends. Once the prose is removed, the code will execute correctly.",
