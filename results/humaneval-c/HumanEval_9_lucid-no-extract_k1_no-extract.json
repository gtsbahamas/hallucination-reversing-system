      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains non-code text (the trace-through explanation) that was accidentally included in the function body.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 2-9 (the entire trace-through explanation that starts with \"Looking at this problem...\" and ends with \"...output [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\")\n\n**What the fix should be:** Delete all the explanatory text between the docstring and the actual function implementation. The function should start directly with:\n```python\ndef rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment\n    in the sequence.\n    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])\n    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []\n    current_max = numbers[0]\n    \n    for num in numbers:\n        current_max = max(current_max, num)\n        result.append(current_max)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:** The trace-through explanation contains invalid Python syntax (the arrow character '\u2192' and other prose). This text should be a comment or removed entirely, not part of the executable code. The actual implementation logic (lines 10-18 in the current version) is correct and will work once the explanatory text is removed.",
