      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix needed** \u2014 the implementation is correct.\n\n### Analysis:\nAll test claims pass, and the implementation correctly:\n1. Returns the decimal part by computing `number - int(number)`\n2. Works for all positive floating point numbers as specified\n3. Guarantees the result is in [0, 1) range\n\n### Why it works:\n- For positive numbers, `int(number)` truncates toward zero, giving the floor (largest integer \u2264 number)\n- Subtracting this from the original number isolates the fractional part\n- Example: `truncate_number(3.5)` \u2192 `3.5 - 3` \u2192 `0.5` \u2713\n\nThe function meets all specification requirements and passes all test cases.",
