      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring contains unescaped quotes that are terminating the string literal prematurely.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 3-11 (the docstring)\n\n**The fix**: \n- Change `don't` to `do not` on line 9 to avoid the apostrophe terminating the string\n- Alternatively, use triple double-quotes (`\"\"\"`) for the docstring instead of checking for apostrophes, but the apostrophe in \"that's\" (lines 3, 5) and \"don't\" (line 9) needs to be handled\n\n**Specific change**:\nReplace line 9:\n```python\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n```\n(Change \"didn't\" to \"did not\")\n\nAlso check line 3 and line 5 for \"that's\" - these should be fine with triple quotes, but the issue is likely on line 9 where \"didn't\" appears.\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The apostrophe in contractions like \"don't\" or \"didn't\" is being interpreted as a string delimiter, causing the string to terminate prematurely. Removing contractions or properly escaping them will allow the docstring to be parsed correctly.\n\n**Note**: Looking at the actual docstring in the specification, it uses \"did not\" already, so the implementation should match that exactly. The current implementation likely has \"didn't\" which causes the syntax error.",
