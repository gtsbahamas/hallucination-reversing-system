      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the code comments. The problem is that there's an apostrophe in \"it's\" within a comment that's being interpreted as a string delimiter.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line 26 (or wherever the comment \"Otherwise, it's impossible\" appears)\n\n**The fix:** \n- Remove or escape the apostrophe in the comment, or simply rewrite the comment\n- Change `- Otherwise, it's impossible` to `- Otherwise, it is impossible`\n- Or ensure this text is properly part of a comment block\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe Python interpreter is seeing the apostrophe in \"it's\" as the start of a string literal, which is never closed, causing a SyntaxError. By removing or escaping the apostrophe, or ensuring it's in a proper comment, the syntax error will be resolved.\n\n**Note:** The actual logic of the implementation appears correct based on the specification. The issue is purely syntactic - the comment text is being interpreted as code rather than as a comment. Make sure all explanatory text is either:\n1. Properly formatted as comments (starting with `#`)\n2. Part of a docstring (enclosed in triple quotes)\n3. Or removed from the code file entirely",
