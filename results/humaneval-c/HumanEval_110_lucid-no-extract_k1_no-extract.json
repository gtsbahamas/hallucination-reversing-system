      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the docstring. The problem is that the docstring contains a line starting with `3.` which is being interpreted as part of the code rather than documentation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** The docstring (lines 2-14 in the function definition)\n\n**The fix:**\nThe current implementation has explanatory text mixed into the docstring that's causing a syntax error. The docstring should only contain the original specification, not the implementation notes.\n\n**Specific change:**\nRemove all the implementation reasoning text (the \"Looking at this problem...\", \"Key insights:\", \"Strategy:\", and \"Let me trace through...\" sections) that appears before the actual function definition. This text should either be:\n1. Removed entirely, OR\n2. Placed as comments outside/before the function, OR  \n3. Placed as comments inside the function body (after the docstring)\n\nThe docstring should only contain:\n```python\n\"\"\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,\nand determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\nbetween them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\nThere is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\nIf it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\nall the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\nOtherwise, return \"NO\".\nFor example:\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\nIt is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the implementation notes as part of the code. By keeping only the proper docstring, the function will have valid Python syntax and the logic (which appears correct) will execute properly.",
