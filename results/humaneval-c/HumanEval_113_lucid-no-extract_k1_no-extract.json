      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The error is a syntax error in the comments/docstring, not in the actual code logic. The line `- '11111111': odd digits are all 1s = 8 odd digits` is being interpreted as Python code rather than a comment.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n**Lines to change:** The comment section before the function definition (lines explaining the examples)\n\n**What to fix:**\n1. Either remove the explanatory comments entirely (they're not part of the function)\n2. Or ensure all explanation lines start with `#` to be proper Python comments\n3. The actual function implementation appears correct and doesn't need changes\n\n**Specific change:**\nRemove or properly comment out lines 5-17 (the explanation section starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...= 8 odd digits\"). These lines are currently being parsed as Python code instead of comments.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse `- '11111111': odd digits are all 1s = 8 odd digits` as code. The `1s` is being interpreted as a numeric literal (1 followed by 's'), which is invalid. By removing these explanatory lines or prefixing them with `#`, Python will no longer try to parse them as executable code.\n\n**The actual function logic (lines 18-27) is correct** and implements the specification properly:\n- Counts odd digits correctly\n- Uses the right template string\n- Replaces 'i' with the count as required",
