      "remediation": "The current implementation is **already correct** and passes all test cases. No fixes are needed.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe implementation correctly identifies that:\n1. The minimum sum of 4 positive even numbers is 8 (2+2+2+2)\n2. Any even number \u2265 8 can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n3. Odd numbers can never be expressed as such a sum (sum of evens is always even)\n\nThe condition `n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0` perfectly captures these requirements.\n\n## Verification\n- **n=4**: Returns False \u2713 (less than minimum sum of 8)\n- **n=6**: Returns False \u2713 (less than minimum sum of 8)  \n- **n=8**: Returns True \u2713 (8 = 2+2+2+2)\n- **n=10**: Returns True \u2713 (10 = 2+2+2+4)\n- **Odd numbers**: Return False \u2713 (sum of evens cannot be odd)\n\n**No changes required.**",
