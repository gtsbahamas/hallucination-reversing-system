      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains comments/explanation text that's not properly formatted as comments, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 2-14 (the explanation text before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or comment out the explanation text that appears before the function definition. The explanation text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...return 'aaaaaaa'\" needs to be either:\n1. Deleted entirely, OR\n2. Converted to proper Python comments by prefixing each line with `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The text is being interpreted as Python code rather than comments, causing a syntax error. Python requires all non-code text to be either in strings or prefixed with `#` to be treated as comments.\n\n**Additional note**: The function implementation itself appears correct (the alternative clearer approach at the end is the right solution), but the syntax error prevents it from being parsed and executed.",
