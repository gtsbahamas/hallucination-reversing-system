      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains a syntax error due to a Unicode arrow character (\u2192) in a comment that Python's parser is rejecting.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 32 (and any other lines with the \u2192 character)\n\n**The fix**:\n1. Replace the \u2192 character with a simple ASCII arrow like `->` or just remove it entirely\n2. Scan all comments for any other non-ASCII characters that might cause similar issues\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Line 32: Change `'catac'` to `'catac'` (remove the \u2192 or replace with `->`)\n- Check lines around 28-32 in the trace-through comments for similar issues\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nPython source code must use ASCII-compatible characters. While Unicode characters are allowed in strings and comments in Python 3, the specific arrow character (U+2192) is causing a syntax error. Replacing it with ASCII equivalents or removing it will allow the code to parse correctly.\n\n**Note**: The actual algorithm implementation (lines after the docstring) appears correct based on the specification. The issue is purely in the explanatory comments at the top of the code.",
