      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is correct, but there are syntax errors in the comments/docstring due to invalid Unicode characters (\u2713 and Cyrillic characters).\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 10-16 (the comment block before the implementation)\n\n**Fix**: Remove the entire comment block that contains the trace-through examples with invalid Unicode characters. The comment block starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the trace examples should be deleted.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete lines containing \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\"\n- Delete lines containing the bullet points about generating rotations and checking substrings\n- Delete lines containing \"Let me trace through an example:\"\n- Delete all the trace examples for `cycpattern_check(\"abab\",\"baa\")` and `cycpattern_check(\"himenss\",\"simen\")` that contain \u2713 and Cyrillic characters\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe Python interpreter is encountering a SyntaxError because the checkmark symbol (\u2713) and Cyrillic characters in the comments are invalid in Python source code. The actual function implementation (lines starting with `for i in range(len(b)):`) is correct and doesn't need modification. Only the explanatory comments need to be removed or replaced with ASCII-only characters.\n\n**Result**: Keep only the function definition with its docstring and the implementation body (the for loop and return statements).",
