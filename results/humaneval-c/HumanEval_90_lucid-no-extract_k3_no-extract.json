      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is correct, but there's explanatory text mixed into the function definition that's causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove lines 2-12 (the explanatory text between the function signature and the actual implementation)\n\n**The fix**:\n- Delete all the text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Here's my approach:\" and the numbered list\n- Keep only:\n  1. The function signature: `def next_smallest(lst):`\n  2. The docstring (lines with triple quotes)\n  3. The actual implementation code (the if statements and return statements)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe explanatory text is not in a comment or string format, so Python tries to parse it as code. \"Looking\" followed by \"at\" looks like a variable name followed by another token, which creates the \"invalid decimal literal\" syntax error. Removing this prose leaves only valid Python code.\n\n**Result**: The actual implementation logic is already correct and will pass all tests once the explanatory text is removed.",
