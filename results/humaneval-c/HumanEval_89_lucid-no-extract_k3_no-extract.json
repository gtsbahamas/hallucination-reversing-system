      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in what appears to be comments, but they're not actually preceded by `#`, making them invalid Python syntax.\n\n**Fix**: Lines 14-17 need to be properly commented out or removed.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Lines 14-17**: These lines contain the pattern analysis with arrow characters (\u2192). They need to be either:\n  1. Prefixed with `#` to make them proper comments, OR\n  2. Removed entirely (they're just analysis notes)\n\n**Recommended fix**:\nRemove lines 14-17 entirely, as they were just working notes to understand the problem and aren't needed in the final implementation.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep them as documentation:\n```python\n# - 'hi' \u2192 'lm': h\u2192l (shift 4), i\u2192m (shift 4)\n# - 'asdfghjkl' \u2192 'ewhjklnop': a\u2192e (shift 4), s\u2192w (shift 4), etc.\n# - 'gf' \u2192 'kj': g\u2192k (shift 4), f\u2192j (shift 4)\n# - 'et' \u2192 'ix': e\u2192i (shift 4), t\u2192x (shift 4)\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: Python syntax requires all non-code text to be in comments (prefixed with `#`) or strings. The arrow characters and text were being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.",
