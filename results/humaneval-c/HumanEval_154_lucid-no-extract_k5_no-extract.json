These comments were meant to be explanatory text but were included in the actual Python code.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 2-13 (all the explanatory text between the docstring and the actual function implementation)\n\n**What to fix:**\n- Delete the entire block starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...is in \"himenss\" \u2192 True\"\n- Keep only the function signature, docstring, and the actual implementation (the for loop and return statements)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe explanatory text contains invalid Python syntax (markdown formatting, special Unicode arrow characters). This text should not be part of the function body. The actual implementation logic (lines 14-18 in the current code) is correct and just needs the invalid text removed.\n\n**Result should be:**\n```python\ndef cycpattern_check(a , b):\n    \"\"\"You are given 2 words.
