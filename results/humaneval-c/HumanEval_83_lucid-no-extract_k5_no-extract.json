      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains markdown-style comments that are not valid Python syntax. The numbered list items (1., 2., 3.) and the markdown bold syntax (**text**) are causing syntax errors.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Lines 11-23 (the entire comment block with the breakdown)\n- **What to do**: Remove or convert the markdown-formatted comments to proper Python comments using `#`\n- **Why**: Python doesn't recognize markdown syntax. The asterisks and numbered lists are being interpreted as code, causing syntax errors.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Either delete lines 11-23 entirely (the detailed breakdown comments)\n2. Or convert them to Python comments by prefixing each line with `#` and removing markdown syntax:\n   - Change `1. **Start with 1**:` to `# Start with 1:`\n   - Change `2. **End with 1**:` to `# End with 1:`\n   - Change `3. **Start with 1 AND end with 1**:` to `# Start with 1 AND end with 1:`\n   - Remove the `**` bold markers\n   - Prefix all explanation lines with `#`\n\nThe actual logic in lines 29-32 is correct and should remain unchanged. Only the comment formatting needs to be fixed.",
