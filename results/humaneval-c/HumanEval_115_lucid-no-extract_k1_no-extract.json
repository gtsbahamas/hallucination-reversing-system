      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains explanatory text that's not properly commented out. The line starting with \"For each well...\" is being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 18-38 (all the explanatory text between the docstring and the actual function implementation)\n\n**The fix:** Remove or comment out all the explanatory text. The file should go directly from the docstring (ending at line 17) to the function implementation (starting with `def max_fill(grid, capacity):`).\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:** \n- The explanatory text \"Looking at this problem...\", \"Let me trace through Example 1:\", etc. is not valid Python syntax\n- Python is trying to parse \"For each well (row), I need to count the 1s...\" as code, which starts with an invalid token\n- The actual implementation logic at the end is correct; it just needs the non-code text removed\n\n**Specific action:** Delete lines 18-38 entirely, keeping only:\n1. The function signature with docstring (lines 1-17)\n2. The actual implementation (the last 6 lines with the for loop logic)",
