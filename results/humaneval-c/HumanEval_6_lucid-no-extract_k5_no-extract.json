      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has Python code mixed with natural language comments outside of proper comment syntax, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-11 (the explanation text before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the explanatory text that appears before the function definition. The explanation starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Track the maximum depth seen so far\" should be deleted entirely.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \n- Python cannot parse plain English text that isn't in a string or comment\n- The actual function implementation (starting from `def parse_nested_parens...`) is correct\n- Only the non-code explanation text needs to be removed\n- The logic itself is sound: it splits by spaces, tracks depth with counters, and records the maximum depth for each group\n\n**Result**: The file should start directly with the function definition, keeping only the implementation from `def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:` onwards.",
