      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The implementation is actually **correct** based on the examples, but there's a terminology confusion in the specification.\n\n**Analysis**: \n- The spec says \"more than 1 duplicate\" which could be interpreted as \"more than 1 copy beyond the original\" (i.e., 3+ total occurrences)\n- The examples clarify this: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` \u2192 True (2 occurrences OK), `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` \u2192 False (3 occurrences not OK)\n- Current implementation checks `count > 2`, which matches the examples perfectly\n\n**Conclusion**: **No code changes needed**. The implementation is correct.\n\n**Optional improvement** (for clarity only):\n- **Line with comment** (line starting with `# Check for more than 1 duplicate`): \n  - Change comment to: `# Check for more than 2 occurrences of the same number`\n  - This better reflects what the code actually does and aligns with the examples\n\n**Why this is the right interpretation**:\n- The examples are the source of truth when specification wording is ambiguous\n- \"More than 1 duplicate\" in the spec means \"more than 2 total occurrences\" based on the test cases\n- The current logic `count > 2` correctly implements this requirement",
