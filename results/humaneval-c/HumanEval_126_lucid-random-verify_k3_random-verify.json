      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Identified:**\nThe specification states \"If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, return False\" which means if a number appears MORE THAN TWICE (i.e., 3 or more times), return False. However, the current implementation checks `if count > 2`, which correctly identifies numbers appearing 3+ times.\n\nWait, let me re-read the specification more carefully: \"more than 1 duplicate\" means:\n- 1 duplicate = 2 occurrences (original + 1 duplicate) \u2713 allowed\n- More than 1 duplicate = 3+ occurrences (original + 2+ duplicates) \u2717 not allowed\n\nThe current logic `if count > 2` is correct for this interpretation.\n\n**Actual Issue:**\nLooking at the examples again, particularly:\n- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) \u279e True` - has pairs of duplicates\n- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) \u279e False` - has triple\n\nThe edge case issue is likely with **empty lists** or the interpretation of \"more than 1 duplicate.\"\n\nRe-reading: \"more than 1 duplicate of **the same number**\" - this means for ANY single number, if it appears more than twice, return False.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n**Line to change:** Line 24\n```python\nif count > 2:\n```\n\n**Should be:**\n```python\nif count >= 3:\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\nWhile `count > 2` and `count >= 3` are logically equivalent, the edge case might be in how we're interpreting the boundary. However, this is already correct.\n\n**Alternative interpretation - the REAL issue:**\n\nThe condition should actually be checking if count is **strictly greater than 2**, which it does. The bug must be elsewhere or in edge cases like empty list handling.\n\n**Actual Fix Needed:**\n\nNo changes needed to the logic. The implementation is correct. The \"edge case\" failure might be a false positive in testing, or there's an issue with how empty lists or single-element lists are handled, but lines 10-11 already handle those correctly.\n\nIf forced to suggest a fix: Ensure the Counter import doesn't cause issues by moving it to the top of the function or checking for empty counter results, but the current implementation should work correctly for all specified examples.",

      "remediation": "Looking at the specification and test results, I need to analyze what \"more than 1 duplicate\" means.\n\nFrom the examples:\n- `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` \u279e True (each number appears at most 2 times)\n- `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` \u279e False (2 appears 3 times)\n\nThe phrase \"more than 1 duplicate\" is ambiguous, but the examples clarify it means: **if any number appears MORE THAN 2 times total, return False**.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line 29\n```python\nif count > 2:\n```\n\n**Current issue:** The condition `count > 2` correctly identifies when a number appears more than twice (3+ times), which should return False. This logic appears correct based on the examples.\n\n**Wait - let me reconsider the edge case:**\n\nLooking at the empty list case - the function returns `True` for an empty list, which seems reasonable but might not match expected behavior.\n\n**Actual Fix:**\n\nThe logic seems correct. However, there might be an issue with how \"duplicate\" is interpreted. Let me check if the issue is with the empty list:\n\n**Lines 10-11:** The empty list case returns `True`, but this might need verification against the actual test expectations.\n\n**Most likely fix:** The empty list edge case at lines 10-11 should potentially return `True` (which it does), but if tests are failing, verify this is the expected behavior.\n\n**Alternative interpretation:** If tests are still failing, the issue might be that an empty list should be handled differently, or there's a subtle bug in the sorting check.\n\n**Concrete fix:** Without seeing the actual failing test case, the most likely issue is the empty list edge case. If `is_sorted([])` should return `False` instead of `True`, change line 11 from `return True` to `return False`.",
