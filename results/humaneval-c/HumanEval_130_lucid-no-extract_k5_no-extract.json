But since `n+1` is even when n is odd, we can compute it directly using rule 2.\n                                                                      ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 25)\n\nStdout:\n",
      "remediation": "The issue is a **syntax error** caused by improperly formatted code. The explanation text is appearing in the actual Python file instead of being in comments or removed entirely.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 2-11 (the explanation text that starts with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...using rule 2.\")\n\n**The fix:**\nDelete all the explanation text between the function definition and the actual implementation. The file should start directly with:\n\n```python\ndef tri(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return [1]\n    \n    result = [1, 3]  # tri(0) = 1, tri(1) = 3\n    ...\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe explanation text contains backticks and quotes that Python is interpreting as string literals, but they're not properly formatted as Python strings or comments. This creates unterminated string literals. Removing this prose text (which should have been comments or documentation) will eliminate the syntax error and allow the actual implementation code to run.\n\nThe implementation logic itself appears correct - it just needs the non-code text removed.",
