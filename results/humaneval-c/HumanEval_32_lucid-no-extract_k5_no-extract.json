      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation contains prose text that's not in a comment or string. The actual code needs to be clean Python without the explanatory text mixed in.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire function body needs to be replaced with just the working code implementation, removing all the prose explanation.\n\n**The fix:**\nReplace the current `find_zero` function with:\n\n```python\ndef find_zero(xs: list):\n    def poly_derivative(xs: list, x: float):\n        \"\"\"Evaluates the derivative of polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.\"\"\"\n        return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])\n    \n    # Newton-Raphson method starting from x = 0\n    x = 0.0\n    \n    for _ in range(1000):  # Maximum iterations\n        fx = poly(xs, x)\n        if abs(fx) < 1e-10:  # Close enough to zero\n            return x\n        \n        dfx = poly_derivative(xs, x)\n        if abs(dfx) < 1e-10:  # Derivative too small\n            x += 0.1  # Nudge it a bit\n            continue\n        \n        x = x - fx / dfx\n    \n    return x\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe current implementation has explanatory prose text (\"Looking at this problem...\", \"Key observations:\", etc.) that's not valid Python syntax. This text needs to be removed, leaving only the actual function implementation. The Newton-Raphson method implementation at the end is correct and should work for finding polynomial zeros.",
