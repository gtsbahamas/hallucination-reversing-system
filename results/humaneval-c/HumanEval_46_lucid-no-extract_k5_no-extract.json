      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The error is a syntax error caused by the checkmark character '\u2713' in the comments/reasoning section that was accidentally included in the actual Python file.\n\n**Fix**: Remove the entire reasoning/verification section that appears before the function definition. This section contains:\n- The \"Looking at this problem...\" paragraph\n- The \"Given:\" bullet points\n- The \"Let me verify with the examples:\" section with checkmarks\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete all lines from \"Looking at this problem...\" up to (but not including) the `def fib4(n: int):` line\n- Keep only the function definition and its implementation\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The checkmark characters and the entire verification section are not valid Python syntax. They appear to be reasoning/scratch work that should have been removed before submitting the code. The actual function implementation itself is correct and will work once this extraneous text is removed.\n\nThe function logic is sound:\n- Base cases for n=0,1,2,3 are correct\n- Iterative sliding window approach correctly computes subsequent values\n- No changes needed to the actual implementation code",
