No fix is needed.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe implementation correctly solves the problem by:\n\n1. **Counting total even numbers** across both lists combined\n2. **Comparing** this count to the size of `lst1`\n3. **Returning \"YES\"** if there are enough even numbers to fill `lst1`, otherwise \"NO\"\n\nThis approach is valid because:\n- We can exchange unlimited elements between the lists\n- To make `lst1` all even, we need at least `len(lst1)` even numbers total\n- The remaining elements (whatever they are) will go to `lst2`\n\nThe logic correctly handles both provided examples:\n- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`: 4 total evens \u2265 4 needed \u2192 \"YES\" \u2713\n- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`: 3 total evens < 4 needed \u2192 \"NO\" \u2713\n\n**No changes required.**",
