      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains non-Python text (comments/reasoning) that should be removed. The actual implementation logic is correct, but it's embedded in explanatory text that causes a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**:\n1. **Remove lines 1-45** (all the reasoning/explanation text before the function definition)\n2. **Keep only the function definition** starting from `def order_by_points(nums):` through the end of the implementation\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete everything before the `def order_by_points(nums):` line\n- Keep the complete function implementation (lines with `def digit_sum(n):`, the logic inside it, and the `return sorted(...)` statement)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe syntax error occurs because the file contains natural language explanation with special characters (like `\u2192`) that Python tries to parse as code. The actual function implementation is correct - it properly:\n- Handles the digit sum calculation for negative numbers (only first digit negative, rest positive)\n- Uses stable sort with index as secondary key to maintain original order for equal sums\n- The logic matches the expected behavior from the examples\n\nThe fix is simply to extract the clean function code without the surrounding explanation.",
