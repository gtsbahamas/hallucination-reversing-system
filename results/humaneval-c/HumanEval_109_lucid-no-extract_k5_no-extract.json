      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\nThe error is a **syntax error** caused by the docstring not being properly closed. The issue is on **line 36** where the comment continues outside the function definition.\n\n### Specific Changes:\n\n**Lines to fix: 1-24 (the entire docstring and comments section)**\n\nThe problem is that the multi-line string (docstring) starting at line 1 is not properly terminated before the code begins. The comments that should be inside the function are actually appearing as if they're part of an unclosed string.\n\n### The Fix:\n\n1. **Ensure the docstring is properly closed** - The triple quotes `\"\"\"` that open the docstring must have matching closing triple quotes `\"\"\"` before any code begins.\n\n2. **Move the algorithm explanation** - The \"Looking at this problem...\" section and the numbered algorithm steps (lines 25-36 in the current version) should either be:\n   - Removed entirely (they're implementation notes, not part of the function)\n   - Converted to proper Python comments with `#` prefix\n   - Placed outside the function definition\n\n3. **The actual function should start immediately after the docstring closes** with `if not arr:`\n\n### Why this fixes the issue:\n\nThe Python interpreter sees the opening `\"\"\"` of the docstring but never finds the closing `\"\"\"`, so it treats everything after as part of the string literal. When it encounters the numbered list item `5.` on line 36, it sees a quote character within what it thinks is still an unclosed string, causing the \"unterminated string literal\" error.\n\nThe fix ensures proper string termination and valid Python syntax by either removing the explanatory comments or properly formatting them as comments outside the string context.",
