      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error is a syntax error caused by non-ASCII characters (\u00d7) in what appears to be a comment or docstring that got included in the actual code file.\n\n**Root Cause**: The implementation explanation/trace (lines starting with \"- special_factorial(4) = 4! \u00d7 3! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 1!\" etc.) was included in the Python file outside of a comment or docstring, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**:\n1. **Remove lines 17-22** (or whatever lines contain the trace explanation with \u00d7 symbols)\n   - These are the lines:\n     ```\n     - special_factorial(4) = 4! \u00d7 3! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 1!\n     - 4! = 24\n     - 3! = 6\n     - 2! = 2\n     - 1! = 1\n     - Result = 24 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 288 \u2713\n     ```\n\n2. **Keep only the function definition** (lines 1-16 in the current implementation)\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The actual function implementation is correct. The syntax error occurs because explanatory text was accidentally included as executable Python code. Removing this text will allow the function to run properly.\n\n**Note**: The core algorithm is correct - it iteratively calculates factorials and multiplies them together to get the special factorial.",
