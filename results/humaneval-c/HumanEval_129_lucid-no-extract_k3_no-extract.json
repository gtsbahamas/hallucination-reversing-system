      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue with the docstring. The problem is that the docstring contains unescaped quotes or isn't properly terminated. However, the actual logic issue is more important:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The current implementation assumes we always alternate between 1 and its minimum neighbor, but this is only correct when k > 1. When k = 1, we should just return [1].\n\n**Lines to change**:\n\n1. **Lines 48-52** (the path building logic):\n   ```python\n   # Current (incorrect):\n   path = []\n   for step in range(k):\n       if step % 2 == 0:\n           path.append(1)\n       else:\n           path.append(min_neighbor)\n   ```\n\n   **Fix**: Handle the k=1 case separately:\n   ```python\n   if k == 1:\n       return [1]\n   \n   # For k > 1, alternate between 1 and min_neighbor\n   path = []\n   for step in range(k):\n       if step % 2 == 0:\n           path.append(1)\n       else:\n           path.append(min_neighbor)\n   ```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\n- When k=1, we only visit one cell, which should be the cell with value 1 (the global minimum)\n- When k>1, we start at 1, then move to the smallest neighbor, then can move back to 1, and continue alternating\n- The test case `grid = [[5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1` expects output `[1]`, which requires this special handling\n\nThe syntax error in the docstring should also be fixed by ensuring the triple-quoted string is properly closed, but the logic fix above is the critical correction needed for the function to work correctly.",
