      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error message indicates a syntax error with the character '\u2265', but this character appears in a comment/explanation, not in the actual code. The real issue is that the explanation text is not properly formatted as a comment or docstring.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 2-13 (the explanation text between the docstring and the return statement)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or properly comment out the explanation text that appears between the docstring and the function body. The explanation text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...so True \u2713\" needs to be either:\n1. Deleted entirely, OR\n2. Converted to proper Python comments using `#` at the start of each line\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: Python is trying to parse the plain English explanation as Python code, which causes a syntax error. The function logic itself (`return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0`) is correct and doesn't need changes - only the improperly placed explanation text needs to be removed or commented out.\n\n**Recommended fix**: Delete lines containing the explanation text, keeping only:\n- The docstring (lines 1-6)\n- The return statement (the actual implementation)\n\nThis will result in a clean, working function.",
