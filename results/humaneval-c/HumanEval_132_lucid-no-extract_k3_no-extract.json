      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the test file, but let me focus on the logical problem with the implementation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The current logic checks if there are \u22652 opening brackets before a position AND \u22652 closing brackets after that position. However, this doesn't guarantee a valid nested subsequence exists.\n\n**Counter-example**: `']]][[['` \n- At position 3 (first `[`): open_count could be 0, close_count could be 3\n- At position 4: open_count could be 1, close_count could be 2\n- The logic might incorrectly identify nesting possibilities\n\n**Root Issue**: The algorithm doesn't verify that the brackets can actually form valid pairs. It only counts brackets without checking if they can be properly matched.\n\n**Fix Strategy**:\n\n1. **Lines to change**: The entire checking logic (lines with `open_count` and `close_count` arrays)\n\n2. **New approach**: \n   - For each position `i`, count how many `[` are at positions `< i` \n   - Count how many `]` are at positions `> i`\n   - Check if `min(opens_before, closes_after) >= 2`\n   - This ensures we can form at least 2 nested pairs\n\n3. **Better fix**: \n   - At each position, track: \"number of `[` before this position\" and \"number of `]` after this position\"\n   - If both are \u2265 2, we can potentially form `[[...]]` pattern\n   - But we need to ensure the brackets between can also be validly matched\n\n4. **Correct approach**:\n   - Check if at any position `i`, there are at least 2 `[` before it and at least 2 `]` after it\n   - Additionally verify that between these positions, brackets can form valid pairs\n   - Simpler: check if `min(count_of_'[' before position i, count_of_']' after position i) >= 2` for any `i`\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Keep the counting logic but ensure we're checking at each character position (not just counting)\n- The condition should check if we can form 2 complete nested pairs\n- Current logic is actually close but may have off-by-one errors in how counts are accumulated\n\nThe core issue: need to verify the counts represent brackets that can actually be paired, not just raw counts.",
