      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a syntax error caused by the apostrophe in \"don't\" within what appears to be a comment or docstring that's not properly formatted.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The comment/explanation text before the function definition contains an apostrophe in \"don't\" on line 21, which Python is interpreting as a string delimiter, causing an unterminated string literal error.\n\n**Solution**: Remove the explanatory comments that appear before the function definition. These comments are outside the function and not properly formatted as Python comments (missing `#` prefix).\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines 2-15** (all the explanatory text starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Total collisions = n \u00d7 n = n\u00b2\")\n- **Keep only** the function definition starting with `def car_race_collision(n: int):` and its docstring and implementation\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The explanatory text was meant to be reasoning/comments but wasn't formatted as Python comments (with `#`). The apostrophe in \"don't\" was being interpreted as a string delimiter. Removing this text eliminates the syntax error while preserving the correct implementation logic (which is `return n * n`).\n\nThe implementation itself (`return n * n`) is correct based on the specification - each of n left-to-right cars collides with each of n right-to-left cars exactly once.",
