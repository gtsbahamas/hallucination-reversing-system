      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code has a syntax error because the multi-line comment/reasoning text at the beginning is not properly formatted as a Python comment or docstring.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-14 (the reasoning text before the function definition)\n\n**What to do**: Remove or properly comment out the reasoning text that appears before the function definition. The actual function implementation (lines starting with `def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):`) is correct.\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Delete lines 1-14 (all the text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...Not be followed by anything...\")\n- Keep only the function definition starting from `def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe reasoning text contains characters like parentheses and periods that Python interprets as code syntax rather than comments. Since it's not prefixed with `#` or enclosed in triple quotes, Python tries to parse it as executable code, resulting in a syntax error. Removing this text will allow the actual function code to execute properly.\n\nThe function logic itself is sound and should pass the tests once the syntax error is resolved.",
