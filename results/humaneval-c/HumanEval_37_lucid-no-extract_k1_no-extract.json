      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has explanatory text outside of a comment or docstring, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove lines 1-5 (the explanatory text before the function definition)\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Delete the entire block starting with \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\" through \"Result: [3, 6, 5, 4]\"\n- Keep only the function definition starting with `def sort_even(l: list):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nPython code cannot have plain text outside of strings, comments, or docstrings. The explanatory text was placed directly in the module scope, which is invalid Python syntax. The actual function implementation is correct and will work once the extraneous text is removed.\n\nThe function logic itself is sound:\n1. Extracts and sorts values at even indices\n2. Creates a copy of the original list\n3. Places sorted values back at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)\n4. Returns the modified list",
