      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error indicates a syntax error with the '\u00d7' character, but this is actually in a comment/docstring that was accidentally included in the actual code file outside of the function definition.\n\n**Root Cause**: The implementation explanation text (starting with \"Looking at this problem...\") appears to have been included in the Python file outside the function, causing a syntax error when Python tries to parse the line `- special_factorial(4) = 4! \u00d7 3! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 1!` as code.\n\n**Fix**:\n1. **Remove lines before the function definition**: Delete all the explanatory text that appears before `def special_factorial(n):`. This includes:\n   - \"Looking at this problem, I need to calculate...\"\n   - \"Let me trace through the example:\"\n   - The bullet points with calculations\n   - \"Here's the implementation:\"\n\n2. **Keep only the function definition**: The file should start directly with `def special_factorial(n):` and contain only the function code.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The syntax error occurs because Python is trying to execute the explanation text as code. By removing everything except the function definition itself, the file will contain only valid Python syntax. The actual function implementation is correct and doesn't need any changes.",
