      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in what appears to be comments explaining the logic. These characters are causing a syntax error because they're not properly formatted as Python comments.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 15-18 (the explanation lines with arrows)\n\n**What to do**: \n1. Remove or properly comment out the explanation lines that contain the \u2192 character\n2. These lines should either be:\n   - Deleted entirely (they're just explanatory notes)\n   - Prefixed with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n   - Replaced with ASCII-only characters if kept as comments\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse lines with special Unicode characters (\u2192) as code rather than comments. The actual implementation logic (lines with `def encrypt(s):`, `for char in s:`, etc.) appears correct for the 4-position shift requirement. Once the non-comment explanation text is removed or properly commented, the function should execute correctly.\n\n**Recommended action**: Delete lines 15-18 entirely, as they're redundant with the docstring examples and the implementation is already clear.",
