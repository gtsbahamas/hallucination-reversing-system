      "remediation": "Based on the test results, **no fix is needed** \u2014 all test cases pass.\n\nHowever, if you're seeing issues in practice, here are potential edge cases to verify:\n\n## Potential Issues (if any exist):\n\n1. **Negative numbers**: The spec says \"positive integer n\" but doesn't handle negatives explicitly. If `n` is negative, `str(n)` includes a '-' character which would cause `int(digit_char)` to fail.\n\n2. **Zero input**: `digits(0)` would return 0 (correct, since 0 is even), but worth verifying this is intended behavior.\n\n## Recommended Defensive Fix (optional):\n\nIf you want to handle edge cases more robustly:\n\n**Line to change**: Add input validation at the start\n```python\ndef digits(n):\n    # Add after docstring:\n    n = abs(n)  # Handle negative numbers by taking absolute value\n    \n    # Rest of implementation remains the same\n```\n\n**Why**: This ensures the function works even if called with negative integers, converting them to positive before processing.\n\n---\n\n**Current verdict**: The implementation is correct per specification. No fix required unless you're encountering specific test cases that fail (which aren't shown in the results).",
