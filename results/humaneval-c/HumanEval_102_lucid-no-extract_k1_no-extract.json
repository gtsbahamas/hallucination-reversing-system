      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is being placed inside the docstring, causing a syntax error. The numbered list item \"4. If y is odd...\" is being interpreted as Python code rather than as part of the reasoning.\n\n**Fix**:\n1. **Remove lines 8-17** (the reasoning text that starts with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"4. If y is odd...\")\n2. **Keep only the function definition starting at line 18** with the docstring and implementation\n\n**Corrected structure should be**:\n```\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    \"\"\"This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the\n    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If \n    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n    For example:\n    choose_num(12, 15) = 14\n    choose_num(13, 12) = -1\n    \"\"\"\n    if x > y:\n        return -1\n    \n    if y % 2 == 0:\n        return y\n    elif y - 1 >= x:\n        return y - 1\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The reasoning comments were accidentally included as code outside the docstring, causing Python to try to parse them as statements. Removing them leaves only valid Python syntax.",
