      "remediation": "Based on the test results, **no fix is needed**. \n\n## Analysis\n\nAll test cases pass:\n- \u2705 Handles edge cases (n < 2, n = 1)\n- \u2705 Correctly identifies 2 as prime\n- \u2705 Rejects even numbers > 2\n- \u2705 Correctly identifies composite odd numbers\n- \u2705 Correctly identifies small, medium, and large primes\n- \u2705 Uses efficient trial division up to \u221an\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe current implementation is **correct and complete**. It properly implements the primality test using:\n1. Edge case handling for n < 2\n2. Special case for n = 2\n3. Even number filtering\n4. Trial division by odd numbers from 3 to \u221an\n\nNo changes are required.",
