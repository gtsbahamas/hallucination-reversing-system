      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains a syntax error due to an unterminated string literal. The docstring uses triple quotes but the implementation text after it is not properly formatted as a comment or removed.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n1. **Lines to change**: Lines 20-22 (the explanatory text that starts with \"I'll implement...\")\n\n2. **What to fix**: Remove or comment out the explanatory text that appears after the function definition. This text should not be part of the Python code.\n\n3. **Specific change**: Delete lines 20-22 entirely, or if they were meant to be comments, prefix each line with `#`.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The Python interpreter is treating the text \"I'll implement a function...\" as code, and the apostrophe in \"I'll\" starts a string literal that is never closed, causing a SyntaxError. Removing this non-code text will allow the function to be parsed correctly.\n\n**Note**: The actual function logic appears correct for the specification - it finds all prime numbers less than n. The only issue is the extraneous text that shouldn't be in the code file.",
