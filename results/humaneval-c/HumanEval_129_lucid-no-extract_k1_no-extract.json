      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation has explanatory text mixed with the code, causing a syntax error. The actual Python function needs to contain only valid Python code, not the reasoning/explanation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: Lines 1-31 contain explanation text that's not valid Python syntax. This text appears before and within what should be the function definition.\n\n**Solution**: \n1. **Remove all explanatory text** (everything from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...next_r, next_c = nr, nc\")\n2. **Keep only the function definition** starting from `def minPath(grid, k):` and its implementation\n3. The actual implementation code (lines 33-60 in the current version) is correct and should be preserved as-is\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete lines 1-31 (all the explanation/reasoning text)\n- Keep the function definition and implementation starting with `def minPath(grid, k):`\n- Ensure proper indentation is maintained for the function body\n\n**Why this fixes it**: Python files should contain only valid Python syntax. Comments should use `#` or `\"\"\"docstrings\"\"\"`, not plain text. The implementation logic itself appears sound based on the specification - it finds the minimum value cell, then greedily builds a path by always moving to the minimum-valued neighbor.",
