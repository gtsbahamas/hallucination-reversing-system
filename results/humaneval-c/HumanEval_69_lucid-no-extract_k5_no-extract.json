      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a **syntax error** caused by the docstring not being properly terminated.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The docstring starting at line 1 with `'''` is never closed before the code begins. The implementation code appears directly after the docstring without closing it first.\n\n**Fix:**\n- **Line to change:** After line 10 (after the last example line `search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1`)\n- **What to add:** Add the closing `'''` to terminate the docstring\n- **Why this fixes it:** The Python parser is treating everything after the opening `'''` as part of the string literal until it finds a closing `'''`. Without it, the code `from collections import Counter` and subsequent lines are interpreted as part of the string, causing a syntax error when it encounters characters that can't be in an unterminated string.\n\n**Specific change:**\n```python\n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1\n    '''  # <-- ADD THIS LINE\n    from collections import Counter\n```\n\nThe actual logic of the implementation looks correct - it just needs the docstring to be properly closed.",
