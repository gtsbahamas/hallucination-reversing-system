However, there's a **contradiction in the specification** that needs to be addressed:\n\nThe spec states: \"You may assume that all words will have the same length\" - but the examples clearly show words with different lengths. This suggests the last sentence is incorrect/misleading.\n\n**However, the actual bug is likely:**\nThe current implementation is functionally correct for the given examples. The \"edge case handling\" failure suggests the issue might be with **empty list handling** or the implementation is actually fine but the test expects something different.\n\n**Most Likely Fix:**\n\n**No changes needed to the core logic** - the implementation correctly:\n1. Filters strings with even lengths only (line 17)\n2. Sorts by length first, then alphabetically (line 20)\n\n**Potential edge case issue:**\n- Empty list `[]` should return `[]` - current code handles this correctly\n- List with all odd-length strings should return `[]` - current code handles this correctly\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe implementation appears correct as-is. If tests are failing, verify:\n1. Test expectations match the specification (not the contradictory last sentence)\n2. The function name in tests matches `sorted_list_sum` (not `list_sort` as shown in examples)\n\n**If forced to suggest a change:** Add explicit empty list check at the start (defensive programming):\n```python\nif not lst:\n    return []\n```\nBut this is redundant since the current code already handles it correctly.",
