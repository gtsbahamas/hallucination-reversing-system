This text should not be part of the actual function code.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation includes explanatory text and examples that should be comments or removed entirely, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove lines 2-10 (the explanation and trace-through examples)\n\n**The fix**:\n- Delete all the explanatory text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...no number can appear more than twice.\"\n- Keep only the actual function implementation starting from `def is_sorted(lst):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe special character '\u2192' and the unquoted text are not valid Python syntax. These were meant to be planning notes, not actual code. Removing them leaves only the valid Python function implementation, which correctly:\n1. Checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order\n2. Uses Counter to verify no number appears more than twice\n3. Returns the appropriate boolean result\n\nThe actual implementation logic is correct; it just needs the non-code text removed.",
