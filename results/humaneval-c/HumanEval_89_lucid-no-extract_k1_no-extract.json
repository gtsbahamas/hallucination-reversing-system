      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in what appears to be comments, but they're not actually preceded by `#`, making them invalid Python syntax.\n\n**Fix**: Lines 15-18 need to be properly commented out or removed.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Lines 15-18**: Add `#` at the beginning of each line to make them proper comments, OR remove these lines entirely since they're just analysis notes.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the arrow character (\u2192) and the text as code rather than as comments. By adding `#` or removing these lines, the interpreter will skip over them, allowing the actual function implementation (which appears correct) to execute properly.\n\n**Recommended action**:\nRemove lines 15-18 entirely, as they were just working notes to understand the pattern and aren't needed in the final code. The function implementation itself (lines 20-33) is correct and will work once the syntax error is resolved.",
