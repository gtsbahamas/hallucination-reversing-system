The text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...can be calculated directly.\" should be deleted entirely, as it's causing the syntax error.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nPython code cannot contain plain English text outside of strings or comments. The explanatory text is being interpreted as Python code, which causes a `SyntaxError`. The actual function implementation (starting from `def tri(n):`) appears correct and should work once the preceding text is removed.\n\n**Specific action:**\nDelete everything from line 19 (\"Looking at this problem...\") up to but not including the line `def tri(n):`. Keep only the function definition and its body.",
