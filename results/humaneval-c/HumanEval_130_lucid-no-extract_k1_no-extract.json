      "remediation": "The issue is that the implementation has explanatory text mixed into the Python code, which causes a syntax error. The text \"Looking at this problem...\" should either be removed or converted to a comment.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 19-31 (all the explanatory text before the function definition)\n\n**The fix:**\n- Delete all the text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"The pattern: for odd positions...\"\n- Keep only the actual Python function definition starting with `def tri(n):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse plain English text as Python code. The explanatory text was meant to be documentation or comments but was placed as raw text in the code. Removing it leaves only valid Python syntax.\n\nThe actual function implementation appears correct based on the specification:\n- Handles base cases (n=0, n=1)\n- Correctly implements even case: `1 + i // 2`\n- Correctly implements odd case by calculating `tri(i+1)` directly (since i+1 is even) and using it in the formula\n- Returns a list of the first n+1 numbers",
