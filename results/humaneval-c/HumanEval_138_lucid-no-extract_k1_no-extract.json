      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error indicates a syntax error with the character '\u2265', but this character only appears in the comments/reasoning section, not in the actual function code. The actual issue is that the reasoning text was accidentally included in the Python file outside of comments or docstrings.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Remove lines**: Delete all the explanatory text that appears between the function specification and the actual function definition (the lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True: 8 \u2265 8 and 8 is even, so True \u2713\")\n- **Keep only**: The function definition itself starting with `def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):` and its implementation `return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe reasoning text contains non-ASCII characters (\u2265) and is not properly formatted as Python comments or strings, causing a syntax error. The actual function logic is correct \u2014 it just needs the explanatory prose removed since it's not valid Python syntax.\n\nThe corrected file should only contain:\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    Example\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    \"\"\"\n    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0\n```",
