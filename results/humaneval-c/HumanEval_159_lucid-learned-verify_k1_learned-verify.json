      "remediation": "Looking at the test results, **all tests are passing**. The current implementation is correct and handles all the specified requirements properly:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. Uses `min(need, remaining)` to determine how many carrots can actually be eaten\n2. Calculates total eaten as `number + carrots_to_eat`\n3. Calculates remaining as `remaining - carrots_to_eat`\n4. Handles both cases: when there are enough carrots and when there aren't\n\nAll four examples pass, and all behavioral claims are verified.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No changes needed.** The implementation is correct as-is.\n\nThe logic is sound:\n- When `remaining >= need`: eats exactly `need` carrots\n- When `remaining < need`: eats all `remaining` carrots\n- Properly tracks total eaten and carrots left in both scenarios",
