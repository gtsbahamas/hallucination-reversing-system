      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring is not properly terminated. There's a triple-quoted string that starts on line 2 but the closing `\"\"\"` is missing before the explanation text begins.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Line 10** (the line with the closing `\"\"\"`): This line needs to be moved to come immediately after the docstring examples, before the explanation text starts.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The docstring should end after line 8 (`minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6`)\n- Add the closing `\"\"\"` on line 9\n- The explanation text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" should either be:\n  - Removed entirely (it's just comments/explanation), OR\n  - Converted to regular Python comments using `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: Python is interpreting all the explanation text as part of the docstring because the triple-quoted string was never closed. Once we properly close the docstring after the examples, the function definition will be syntactically correct.\n\n**Recommended approach**: Simply close the docstring after the examples and remove the explanation text, since it's not needed in the actual code:\n\n```\nLines 1-8: Keep as-is (function signature and docstring content)\nLine 9: Add \"\"\"\nLines 10-20: Delete (the explanation text)\nLines 21-28: Keep as-is (the actual implementation)\n```",
