      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The code has a syntax error because the multi-line comment in the docstring contains unescaped special characters and the implementation logic for checking valid rotation is incorrect.\n\n**Fixes needed**:\n\n1. **Lines 1-28 (docstring)**: The docstring is already provided in the specification - remove the duplicate/malformed docstring from the implementation.\n\n2. **Line 58 (final return statement)**: The current check `return arr[-1] <= arr[0]` is insufficient. When there's exactly one break point at position `i`, we need to verify that:\n   - The element after the break (`arr[i+1]`) should be \u2264 the first element (`arr[0]`) - this ensures the rotated portion can come first\n   - The last element (`arr[-1]`) should be \u2264 the first element (`arr[0]`) - this ensures proper wraparound\n   \n   Change to: `return arr[break_pos + 1] <= arr[0] and arr[-1] <= arr[0]`\n\n   However, since `break_pos` is in range `[0, n-2]`, `arr[break_pos + 1]` is the element right after the break. For a valid rotation, we need the segment after the break to connect properly with the segment before it.\n\n   **Better fix**: `return arr[-1] <= arr[0]` is actually checking if the last element can wrap to the beginning. But we also need `arr[break_pos + 1] <= arr[0]` to ensure the element after the break is small enough to be at the start.\n   \n   Change line 58 to: `return arr[break_pos + 1] <= arr[0] and arr[-1] <= arr[0]`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\n- Removes syntax error from malformed docstring\n- The condition `arr[break_pos + 1] <= arr[0]` ensures the smallest element (after the break) can be rotated to the front\n- The condition `arr[-1] <= arr[0]` ensures the wraparound is valid (last element connects properly to the beginning)\n- Both conditions together verify that rotation produces a valid sorted array",
