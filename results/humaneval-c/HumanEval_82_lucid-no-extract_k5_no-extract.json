      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has explanatory text outside of comments, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-4 (the explanatory text before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or comment out the explanatory text that appears before the function definition. The text \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\" and the numbered list are not valid Python syntax.\n\n**Specific change**:\n- Delete lines 1-4 entirely, OR\n- Convert them to comments by prefixing each line with `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nPython requires all non-code text to be in comments (prefixed with `#`) or docstrings (enclosed in triple quotes). The current text is neither, so the Python interpreter tries to parse it as code and fails with a syntax error. The actual function implementation (lines 5 onwards) is correct and doesn't need modification.",
