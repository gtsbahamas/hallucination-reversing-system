      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains unescaped quotes in a comment, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 24 (the comment line starting with \"I'll use...\")\n\n**The fix**: \nRemove or properly escape the problematic comment lines that appear between the function signature and the actual implementation. These lines (starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"I'll use a counter approach:\") should not be inside the function body as they contain unescaped apostrophes that break the string literal.\n\n**Specific change**:\nDelete lines 24-32 (all the explanation text that appears after the docstring but before the actual code). The function should go directly from the docstring to `count = 0`.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe apostrophe in \"I'll\" is being interpreted as a string delimiter, causing Python to think there's an unterminated string. Removing these explanatory comments (which should be outside the function or in the docstring) eliminates the syntax error. The actual logic of the function (lines with `count = 0` onwards) is correct and doesn't need modification.",
