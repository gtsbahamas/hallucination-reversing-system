      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has a syntax error because there's explanatory text outside the function that Python is trying to parse as code.\n\n**Fix**: Remove lines 1-5 (the explanatory text before the function definition)\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete the lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"- At the end, the counter must be zero (all brackets matched)\"\n- Keep only the function definition starting from `def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):`\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The explanatory text is not valid Python syntax. It should either be:\n1. Removed entirely (recommended for production code)\n2. Converted to comments (prefix each line with `#`)\n3. Placed inside a docstring or comment block\n\nThe actual implementation logic is correct - it properly tracks bracket depth and returns False if depth goes negative or doesn't end at zero. The only issue is the non-code text causing a syntax error.",
