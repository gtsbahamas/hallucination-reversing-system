      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a **syntax error** in the code structure, not in the actual `histogram` function logic. The error message indicates an \"unterminated string literal\" at line 29, which suggests the problem is with how the code is formatted in the file.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The implementation explanation text is not properly formatted as a comment or docstring, causing Python to interpret it as code.\n\n**Fix**: \n- **Lines to change**: The explanatory text before the function (lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Here's the implementation:\")\n- **What to do**: Either:\n  1. Remove all the explanatory text entirely, OR\n  2. Convert it to comments by prefixing each line with `#`, OR  \n  3. Wrap it in a multi-line string `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` (though this would create an unused string literal)\n\n**Recommended fix**: Remove lines 1-28 (all the explanation text) and keep only the actual function definition starting with `def histogram(test):`.\n\n**Why this fixes it**: Python is trying to parse the plain English text as Python code. The phrase \"Here's the implementation:\" contains an apostrophe which Python interprets as the start of a string literal that never closes, causing the syntax error. Removing or properly commenting out this text will allow Python to parse only the actual function code.\n\nThe `histogram` function logic itself (lines after the explanation) appears correct and should work once the syntax error is resolved.",
