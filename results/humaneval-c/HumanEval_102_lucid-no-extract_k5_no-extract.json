      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains Python comments/explanation text that isn't properly commented out, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 14-17 (the numbered list items)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or properly comment out the explanation text that appears before the function definition. These lines:\n```\n1. If x > y, there's no valid range, return -1\n2. If y is even, it's the largest even number in the range\n3. If y is odd, check if y-1 is even and >= x\n4. If no even number exists in range, return -1\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: These lines are plain text appearing in the middle of Python code without being part of a string or comment. They need to be removed entirely since they're just planning notes, not actual code. The function implementation that follows (lines 18-30) is already correct and implements the logic described in these notes.\n\n**Result**: Keep only the function definition starting from `def choose_num(x, y):` through the end. The actual implementation logic is sound and will work correctly once the syntax error is removed.",
