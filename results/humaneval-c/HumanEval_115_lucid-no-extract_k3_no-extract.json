      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains **comments written as plain text instead of Python comments**. The lines starting with `-` are being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 44-47 (the bullet points in the middle of the function)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove or properly comment out these lines:\n```\n- Count the 1s in that row (total water units)\n- Divide by bucket capacity and round up to get number of trips needed\n- This is exactly what `math.ceil(water_units / capacity)` does\n```\n\nThese are explanatory comments that were left in the code body. They should either be:\n1. Deleted entirely (recommended - they're redundant with the code), OR\n2. Converted to Python comments by prefixing with `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nPython is trying to parse `- Count the 1s...` as a statement. The `-` is interpreted as a minus operator, followed by an identifier `Count`, which creates invalid syntax. Removing these non-code lines will allow Python to parse the actual function implementation correctly.\n\n**Corrected structure should be:**\n```python\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    total_trips = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        water_units = sum(row)\n        trips_needed = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)\n        total_trips += trips_needed\n    return total_trips\n```",
