      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains unescaped text outside of the function that's being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 16-17 (the explanatory text after the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove the explanatory text that appears after the function definition. This text should only be in comments or docstrings, not as bare Python code.\n\n**Specifically**:\n- Delete lines 16-17 entirely (the lines starting with \"For each mismatched pair...\")\n- Keep only the function definition itself\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The text \"For each mismatched pair...\" is not valid Python syntax. It appears to be explanatory comments that were accidentally left as uncommented code. The actual function implementation (lines 18-25 in the original) is correct and doesn't need modification - it properly counts mismatched pairs by comparing elements from both ends of the array.\n\nThe logic itself is sound:\n- Iterates through the first half of the array\n- Compares each element with its mirror position\n- Counts mismatches\n- Returns the count",
