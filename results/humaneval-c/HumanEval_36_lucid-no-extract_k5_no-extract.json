      "remediation": "The issue is that the implementation code contains the explanation/trace-through text, which is causing a syntax error. The actual function implementation is correct, but it's mixed with the analysis comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 2-6 (the explanation text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the trace examples)\n\n**The fix:**\n- Delete all the explanatory text between the function specification and the actual implementation\n- Keep only the function definition starting with `def fizz_buzz(n: int):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the explanation text as code. Lines like \"- fizz_buzz(78): Numbers...\" are not valid Python syntax. The actual implementation logic (lines 7-11 in the current code) is correct and will work once the explanatory text is removed.\n\n**Corrected structure should be:**\n```\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:\n            count += str(i).count('7')\n    return count\n```",
