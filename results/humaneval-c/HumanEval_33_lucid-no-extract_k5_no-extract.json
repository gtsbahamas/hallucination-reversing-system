The text \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\" and the subsequent explanation should be removed or converted to comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 1-11 (all the explanatory text before the function definition)\n\n**The fix:** Delete everything before `def sort_third(l: list):`. The function implementation itself (lines 12-28 in the current code) is correct and should be kept as-is.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:** Python is trying to parse the English explanation as Python code, which causes a SyntaxError. The actual function implementation is correct - it properly:\n1. Extracts elements at indices divisible by 3\n2. Sorts them\n3. Places them back at the correct positions\n4. Returns the modified list\n\nThe logic matches the specification and would pass the tests once the syntax error is removed.",
