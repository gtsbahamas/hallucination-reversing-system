      "remediation": "Based on the test results, **no fix is needed**. \n\n## Analysis\n\nAll test cases pass:\n- \u2705 Correctly removes elements that occur more than once\n- \u2705 Preserves order of remaining elements\n- \u2705 Handles the example case correctly\n- \u2705 Returns correct type\n- \u2705 Handles edge cases (empty list)\n\n## Current Implementation Assessment\n\nThe implementation is correct:\n1. Uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each element\n2. Filters to keep only elements with `counts[num] == 1` (appear exactly once)\n3. List comprehension iterates in original order, preserving sequence\n4. Handles all edge cases properly\n\n**Conclusion**: The function works as specified. No changes required.",
