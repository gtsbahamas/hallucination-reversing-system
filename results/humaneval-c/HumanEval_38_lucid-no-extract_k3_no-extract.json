      "remediation": "# Fix Plan\n\nThe issue is a **syntax error** caused by non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in the comments that were accidentally included in the implementation.\n\n## Changes needed:\n\n**Remove the analysis comments from the implementation** - they should not be part of the actual code file.\n\nThe implementation itself is correct:\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.\n    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n```\n\n## Why this fixes the issue:\n\nThe syntax error occurs because the preliminary analysis text (lines starting with \"Looking at the `encode_cyclic` function...\" and numbered points like \"2. For groups...\") was included in the Python file. Python cannot parse the arrow character (\u2192) and other prose text as valid syntax.\n\nThe actual decode logic is correct:\n- It reverses the encoding by moving the last character to the front for 3-character groups\n- This undoes the encode operation which moved the first character to the end",
