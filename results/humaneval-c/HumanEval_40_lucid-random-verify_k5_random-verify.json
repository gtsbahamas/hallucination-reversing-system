Three elements at distinct **positions** (indices), OR\n2. Three elements with distinct **values**\n\nLet me check the test case `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])` which returns `True`:\n- The list has duplicate value `1` at indices 0 and 3\n- Possible triples: `1 + 3 + (-2) = 2`, `1 + (-2) + 1 = 0` \u2713\n- The triple that sums to zero uses `l[0]=1, l[2]=-2, l[3]=1`\n\nThis confirms \"distinct\" means **distinct positions**, not distinct values. The current implementation already handles this correctly.\n\n## The Bug\n\nThe current implementation looks correct for the given specification. However, the issue might be with **edge cases**:\n\n1. **Empty list or lists with < 3 elements**: Already handled (returns False)\n2. **Lists with exactly 3 elements**: Should work with current logic\n3. **Potential issue**: None apparent in the logic itself\n\nWait - re-reading \"FAIL: The implementation has bugs in edge case handling\" - let me reconsider if there's an interpretation issue.\n\nActually, the current implementation appears **correct** based on the specification and test cases. \n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix needed** - the implementation correctly:\n- Checks if list has at least 3 elements\n- Uses three nested loops with `i < j < k` to ensure distinct positions\n- Returns True when any triple sums to zero\n- Returns False if no such triple exists\n\nIf tests are still failing, the issue is likely:\n1. In the test harness itself\n2.
