      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation contains non-code text (the explanation) that was accidentally included in the function body. The SyntaxError is triggered by the arrow character `\u2192` in what should have been a comment or removed entirely.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines inside the `decode_cyclic` function body\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove all the explanatory text (lines starting with \"Looking at the `encode_cyclic` function...\" through \"...moving the last character to the front once.\") that appears before the actual implementation. Keep only the actual Python code:\n\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.\n    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe explanatory text was plain English with special characters (like `\u2192`) that Python cannot parse. It should have been removed or placed in comments. The actual implementation logic is correct - it reverses the encoding by moving the last character to the front for groups of 3, which is the inverse of moving the first character to the end.",
