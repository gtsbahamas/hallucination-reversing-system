      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation code contains comments written in a format that Python doesn't recognize as comments. The lines starting with `-` are being interpreted as Python code rather than comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 44-45 (the bullet point comments inside the function)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove or properly comment out these lines:\n```\n- Count the number of 1s (water units)\n- Divide by bucket capacity and round up to get the number of trips needed\n```\n\nThese should either be:\n1. Deleted entirely (they're redundant given the clear variable names), OR\n2. Converted to proper Python comments with `#` prefix\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nPython is trying to parse `- Count the number...` as a statement, which creates a syntax error because `-` followed by text is not valid Python syntax. The actual algorithm implementation (the `for` loop with `sum()` and `math.ceil()`) is correct and matches the specification perfectly. The only issue is these improperly formatted comment lines that snuck into the function body.\n\n**Recommended action:** Simply delete lines 44-45. The code is self-documenting with clear variable names (`water_units`, `trips_needed`), so these comments add no value.",
