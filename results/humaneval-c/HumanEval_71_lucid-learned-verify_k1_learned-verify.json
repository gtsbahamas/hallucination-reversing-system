      "remediation": "Based on the test results, **no fix is needed**. \n\n## Analysis\n\nAll test cases are passing, including:\n- Triangle inequality validation (correctly rejects invalid triangles)\n- Heron's formula calculation (correct area computation)\n- Rounding to 2 decimal places\n- Both provided examples\n\nThe initial \"FAIL\" verdict was reconsidered and changed to \"PASS\" upon closer inspection. The implementation correctly uses `<=` in the triangle inequality check because:\n\n1. The specification requires \"sum of any two sides is **greater than** the third side\" (strict inequality: `a + b > c`)\n2. The implementation checks `if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a: return -1`\n3. This correctly returns -1 when the inequality is violated (including degenerate cases where sum equals the third side)\n\n**Conclusion**: The current implementation is correct and complete.
