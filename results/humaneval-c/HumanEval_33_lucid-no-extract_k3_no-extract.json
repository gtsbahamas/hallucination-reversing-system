      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has explanatory text outside of comments/docstrings, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**: Remove or comment out the explanatory text before the function definition.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n\n**Lines to remove** (lines 1-11 before the function):\n```\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. Extract elements at indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, ...)\n2. Sort those elements\n3. Put the sorted elements back at those same indices\n4. Keep all other elements unchanged\n\nLet me trace through the second example:\n- Input: `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`\n- Indices divisible by 3: 0, 3, 6\n- Elements at those indices: 5 (index 0), 4 (index 3), 2 (index 6)\n- Sorted: [2, 4, 5]\n- Put back: 2 at index 0, 4 at index 3, 5 at index 6\n- Result: `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: Python doesn't allow free-form text outside of strings, comments, or docstrings. The text is being interpreted as code, causing a syntax error. The actual function implementation (starting from `def sort_third(l: list):`) is correct and will work once the preceding text is removed.",
