      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains unescaped text that should be in comments or a docstring, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 20-26 (the strategy explanation section)\n\n**Fix**: \n1. Either remove the strategy explanation entirely (since it's not needed in the final implementation)\n2. OR properly format it as comments by adding `#` at the start of each line\n3. OR wrap it in triple quotes as a docstring\n\n**Recommended approach**: Remove lines 20-26 completely, keeping only:\n```python\ndef pairs_sum_to_zero(l):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in l:\n        if -num in seen:\n            return True\n        seen.add(num)\n    return False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Strategy:\" is not valid Python syntax. It appears to be planning/explanation text that was accidentally left in the code. Removing it leaves only the valid Python implementation, which correctly solves the problem by checking if the negative of each number exists in previously seen numbers.",
