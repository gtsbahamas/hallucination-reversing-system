      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains explanatory text that's not in a comment, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-9 (the text before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the explanatory text before the function definition, or convert it to comments using `#`.\n\n**Specific change**:\n- Delete lines 1-9 entirely (everything from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"- digits(235)...\")\n- Keep only the function definition starting with `def digits(n):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nPython code cannot contain plain English text outside of strings or comments. The text \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\" is being interpreted as Python code, which causes the SyntaxError. The actual function implementation (lines 10-19) is correct and will work once the non-code text is removed.",
