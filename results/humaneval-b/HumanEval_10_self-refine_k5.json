      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect algorithm implementation**: The function finds the longest palindromic **suffix** and appends the reverse of the **prefix**, but according to the docstring, it should find the longest palindromic **postfix** (which is the same as suffix) but the logic is backwards. The current implementation starts from index 0 and finds the **shortest** palindromic suffix, not the longest.\n\n   **Problem**: The loop `for i in range(len(string))` starts at i=0, so `string[i:]` starts with the full string and gets shorter. When it finds the first palindromic suffix, it's actually finding the **longest** one, which is correct. However, let me verify with the examples:\n   \n   - For 'cat': \n     - i=0: is_palindrome('cat')? No\n     - i=1: is_palindrome('at')? No  \n     - i=2: is_palindrome('t')? Yes \u2192 returns 'cat' + 'ca'[::-1] = 'cat' + 'ac' = 'catac' \u2713\n   \n   - For 'cata':\n     - i=0: is_palindrome('cata')? No\n     - i=1: is_palindrome('ata')? Yes \u2192 returns 'cata' + 'c'[::-1] = 'cata' + 'c' = 'catac' \u2713\n\n   Actually, the logic is **correct**. The loop does find the longest palindromic suffix by checking from the full string down to smaller suffixes, and stops at the first (longest) one found.\n\n2. **Re-examining**: Wait, let me reconsider. The loop checks `string[i:]` for i from 0 to len(string)-1. This checks suffixes from longest to shortest, which is correct for finding the longest palindromic suffix.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the implementation appears correct and matches the test cases.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Handles empty strings\n- Finds the longest palindromic suffix by iterating from i=0 (full string) onwards\n- Returns the original string concatenated with the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix\n- Matches all provided test cases",
