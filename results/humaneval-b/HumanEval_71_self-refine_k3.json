The current implementation incorrectly rejects valid triangles where the sum equals the third side (degenerate triangles), but more importantly, the logic is inverted. It should return -1 when `a + b <= c`, which it does, so this part is actually correct. However, for strict mathematical validity, a degenerate triangle (where `a + b == c`) has zero area and might be considered invalid depending on interpretation. The current code handles this correctly by returning -1.\n\n2. **No validation for negative or zero side lengths**: The function doesn't check if `a`, `b`, or `c` are positive numbers. Negative or zero values should make the triangle invalid, but the current code would either:\n   - Pass the validity check with negative numbers (e.g., `triangle_area(-1, -2, -10)` would pass the first check)\n   - Potentially cause issues with the square root calculation if the expression under the root becomes negative\n\n**Corrected implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Check for positive side lengths\n    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Check if the three sides form a valid triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate area using Heron's formula\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2  # semi-perimeter\n    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5\n    \n    return round(area, 2)\n```",
      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n### Changes Required\n\n**Add validation at the beginning of the function (before line 12):**\n\nInsert a new check after the docstring and before the existing triangle validity check:\n\n```python\nif a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Specific Location\n- **Insert between**: Current line 11 (docstring end) and line 12 (first validity check)\n- **New lines**: Add 2-3 lines for the positive value validation\n\n### Why This Fixes the Issue\n\n**Problem**: The function doesn't validate that side lengths are positive numbers. This causes two issues:\n1. Negative values can pass the triangle inequality check (e.g., `-1 + -2 > -10` is true)\n2. Invalid inputs could lead to incorrect area calculations or mathematical errors\n\n**Solution**: Adding the positive value check ensures:\n- All side lengths must be greater than zero\n- Invalid inputs (negative or zero) are rejected early with -1\n- The triangle inequality check operates only on valid positive values\n- Prevents potential issues with Heron's formula when dealing with invalid inputs\n\n### Note on Existing Code\nThe current triangle inequality check (lines 12-13) is **correct as-is** and doesn't need modification. It properly implements the rule that the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side, correctly rejecting degenerate triangles.",

      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Triangle inequality validation is too strict**: The code uses `<=` in the triangle inequality checks (`a + b <= c`), but the docstring specifies \"the sum of any two sides is **greater than** the third side.\" This means the validation should reject cases where the sum equals the third side (degenerate triangles), which the current code correctly does. However, this is actually correct behavior for a proper triangle validation, so this is not an issue.\n\n2. **Missing validation for non-numeric inputs**: The function doesn't handle cases where `a`, `b`, or `c` might be non-numeric types (e.g., strings, None). While not explicitly mentioned in the docstring, this could cause runtime errors.\n\n3. **No explicit handling of infinity or NaN**: If any side is `float('inf')` or `float('nan')`, the function may produce unexpected results rather than returning -1.\n\nActually, upon closer review of the core logic:\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND** with the core implementation.\n\nThe function correctly:\n- Validates that all sides are positive (rejects zero and negative values)\n- Validates the triangle inequality (sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third)\n- Uses Heron's formula correctly to calculate the area\n- Rounds to 2 decimal places as specified\n- Returns -1 for invalid triangles\n\nThe example `triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00` is correct (this is a right triangle with area = 0.5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 6.00).\n\nThe example `triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1` is correct (1 + 2 = 3, which is not greater than 10).\n\nThe implementation matches the specification exactly for all valid use cases described in the docstring.",
