The code correctly handles different lengths.\n\n**Lines 13-14** - Fix function name in examples:\n- **Current**: `assert list_sort([...]) => [...]`\n- **Fix**: `assert sorted_list_sum([...]) => [...]`\n- **Why**: Function is named `sorted_list_sum`, not `list_sort`. Examples should use the correct function name.\n\n### Summary:\nThe implementation logic is **already correct** and needs no changes. The filtering (line 19) and sorting (line 22) work exactly as specified by the examples. Only the docstring contains errors that could confuse users, but these don't affect functionality.",

      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Contradictory assumption in docstring**: The docstring states \"You may assume that all words will have the same length\" at the end, which directly contradicts the earlier requirement to \"sort by length of each word\" and the examples showing words of different lengths. However, this appears to be an error in the docstring itself rather than the implementation, as the examples clearly show different-length words.\n\n2. **The implementation is actually correct**: Despite the confusing docstring, the implementation correctly:\n   - Filters out strings with odd lengths (keeps only even-length strings)\n   - Sorts first by length (ascending)\n   - Then sorts alphabetically for strings of the same length\n   - Matches both provided examples:\n     - `[\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]` \u2192 filters to `[\"aa\"]` (removes \"a\" and \"aaa\" as odd length)\n     - `[\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]` \u2192 filters to `[\"ab\", \"cd\"]` (removes \"a\" and \"aaa\"), then sorts (already in correct order)\n\n**Conclusion**: NO ISSUES FOUND in the implementation itself. The code correctly implements the intended behavior as demonstrated by the examples. The only issue is the contradictory statement in the docstring (\"You may assume that all words will have the same length\"), but this is a documentation error, not a code bug.",
