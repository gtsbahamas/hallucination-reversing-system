      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect range in the loop**: The loop uses `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)`, which starts at index `len(word) - 2` and goes down to index `1` (stopping before `0`). This means it checks positions from the second-to-last character down to the second character. However, this misses checking the character at index `len(word) - 2` properly in the context of \"from the right side.\"\n\n   More specifically, when we say \"from the right side\" and \"vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count,\" we should:\n   - NOT check the last character (index `len(word) - 1`) as a potential vowel\n   - NOT check the first character (index `0`) as a potential vowel\n   - Start checking from index `len(word) - 2` down to index `1`\n\n   The current implementation actually does this correctly, so this is not an issue.\n\n2. **Actually, upon closer inspection, the implementation appears correct**. Let me verify with the examples:\n   - \"yogurt\": Checks indices 4,3,2,1. At i=3 ('u'), checks if 'g' (i=2) and 'r' (i=4) are consonants. Both are, so returns \"u\". \u2713\n   - \"FULL\": Checks indices 2,1. At i=2 ('L'), not a vowel. At i=1 ('U'), checks if 'F' (i=0) and 'L' (i=2) are consonants. Both are, so returns \"U\". \u2713\n   - \"quick\": Checks indices 3,2,1. At i=3 ('c'), not a vowel. At i=2 ('i'), checks if 'u' (i=1) is consonant - it's not, so continues. At i=1 ('u'), checks if 'q' (i=0) and 'i' (i=2) are consonants - 'i' is not, so continues. Returns \"\". \u2713\n   - \"ab\": Length is 2, returns \"\". \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all the requirements and test cases.",
