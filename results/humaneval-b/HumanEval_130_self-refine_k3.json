      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Integer division inconsistency**: The specification states `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` for even n, which suggests regular division. However, the implementation uses `i // 2` (integer division). Looking at the example `tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2`, this works out the same, but for consistency with the spec and to avoid potential issues with larger even numbers, the code should match what's specified. Though in this case, since n/2 for even n always yields an integer, both work - but it's technically a deviation from the spec.\n\n2. **Circular dependency in specification**: The specification has a logical issue (not a code bug per se, but worth noting): For odd n, `tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)` creates a circular dependency since we need `tri(n+1)` to compute `tri(n)`. The implementation correctly resolves this by using the even formula for `tri(n+1)`, but this assumption isn't explicitly stated in the docstring. The code handles this correctly by computing `tri_next = 1 + (i + 1) // 2`.\n\n3. **Missing base case in specification**: The specification doesn't define `tri(0)`, but the example shows `tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]` which implies `tri(0) = 1`. The implementation correctly infers and implements this.\n\n**Actual Code Issues:**\n\nThe implementation is actually **correct** given the examples provided. It properly:\n- Handles the base case `tri(0) = 1`\n- Implements `tri(1) = 3`\n- Uses the even formula for even indices\n- Resolves the odd formula by pre-computing the next even value\n\nHowever, if we want to be pedantic about matching the specification exactly:\n\n**Minor issue**: Use regular division `/` instead of `//` to match the spec exactly (though the result is the same for this problem):\n```python\nresult.append(1 + i / 2)  # instead of 1 + i // 2\ntri_next = 1 + (i + 1) / 2  # instead of 1 + (i + 1) // 2\n```\n\nBut since Python 3 division returns float, and we want integers in the result, the `//` is actually more appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**: NO ISSUES FOUND (the code correctly implements the intended behavior based on the examples).",
