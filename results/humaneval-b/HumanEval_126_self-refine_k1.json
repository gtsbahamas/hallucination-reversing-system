      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect interpretation of \"more than 1 duplicate\"**: The specification states \"If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, return False.\" This means if a number appears MORE THAN TWICE (i.e., 3 or more times), return False. However, the current implementation checks `if count > 2`, which correctly identifies numbers appearing 3+ times. But the phrasing \"more than 1 duplicate\" is ambiguous - it could mean:\n   - More than 1 copy beyond the original (i.e., 3+ total occurrences) \u2713 Current implementation\n   - More than 1 occurrence total (i.e., 2+ occurrences) \u2717 \n\n   Looking at the examples:\n   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) \u279e True` - numbers appear exactly twice (1 duplicate each) \u2192 True\n   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) \u279e False` - number 2 appears three times (2 duplicates) \u2192 False\n\n   This confirms the specification means: if any number has more than 1 duplicate (appears 3+ times total), return False. The implementation is **CORRECT** on this point.\n\n2. **Edge case not explicitly handled but works correctly**: Empty list `[]` would return `True` due to the `len(lst) <= 1` check, which seems reasonable given the specification.\n\nActually, upon careful review of the examples and re-reading the specification:\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Returns `True` for lists with 0 or 1 elements\n- Checks ascending order by comparing adjacent elements\n- Allows numbers to appear at most twice (1 duplicate)\n- Returns `False` if any number appears more than twice (more than 1 duplicate)\n- Matches all provided test cases",
