However, this behavior should be verified as intentional since it's not explicitly documented in the docstring.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, let me reconsider:\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation is correct:\n\n1. **Handles edge cases properly**: \n   - Empty list `[]` \u2192 returns `[]` (derivative of 0 is 0)\n   - Single element `[c]` \u2192 returns `[]` (derivative of constant is 0)\n\n2. **Correct derivative calculation**: For a polynomial `xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + ...`, the derivative is `xs[1] + 2*xs[2]*x + 3*xs[3]*x^2 + ...`, which translates to coefficients `[xs[1], 2*xs[2], 3*xs[3], ...]`. The list comprehension `[i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]` correctly computes this.\n\n3. **Matches the examples**:\n   - `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` = `[1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5]` = `[1, 4, 12, 20]` \u2713\n   - `derivative([1, 2, 3])` = `[1*2, 2*3]` = `[2, 6]` \u2713",
