The phrase \"integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13\" typically implies positive integers in this context. However, since 0 doesn't affect the count (it has no 7s), this doesn't cause incorrect results for the given test cases. If strict correctness is desired, the range should start from 1: `range(1, n)`. But given that the test cases pass, this appears to be acceptable for this implementation.\n\nActually, upon further reflection, since including 0 doesn't affect the output for any test case and the specification doesn't explicitly exclude 0, this is more of a minor semantic consideration than a bug.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND** - The implementation correctly handles all test cases and the logic is sound for the given specification.",
