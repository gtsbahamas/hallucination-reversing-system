      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **no fix is needed**. \n\nAll test cases pass, including:\n- The three provided examples\n- Edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)\n- Both odd and even length arrays\n- The core logic of finding minimum changes\n\nThe implementation is correct as-is. The algorithm properly:\n1. Compares mirror positions `arr[i]` and `arr[n-1-i]`\n2. Counts mismatches (each requiring exactly 1 change)\n3. Only iterates through the first half (`range(n // 2)`)\n4. Handles the middle element correctly in odd-length arrays (no comparison needed)\n\n**Verdict: No changes required.**",
