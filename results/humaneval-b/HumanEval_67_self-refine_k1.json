      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incomplete number parsing**: The function only checks `word.isdigit()`, which will fail for negative numbers (e.g., \"-5\") or numbers that are part of larger strings. While the examples don't show negative numbers, the logic is fragile.\n\n2. **More critically, the function assumes exactly 2 numbers in the string**: The docstring examples all show exactly 2 numbers (apples and oranges), but the implementation uses `sum(numbers)` which would work for any count of numbers. This is actually correct behavior, but there's a subtle issue: if the string format changes or contains unexpected numbers, it could produce wrong results.\n\n3. **No validation**: The function doesn't validate that:\n   - The string contains exactly 2 numbers (as implied by the examples)\n   - The sum of apples and oranges doesn't exceed `n`\n   - `n` is non-negative\n   - The result (number of mangos) is non-negative\n\n4. **Edge case not handled**: If the string contains no numbers at all, `numbers` will be empty, `sum(numbers)` will be 0, and the function will return `n`, which may not be the intended behavior.\n\n**However**, looking at the examples more carefully, the current implementation actually works correctly for all provided test cases. The `isdigit()` approach successfully extracts the two numbers from the string format shown in examples, and `sum(numbers)` correctly subtracts both from `n`.\n\n**Recommendation**: While the code works for the given examples, it could be more robust with:\n- Input validation (checking that exactly 2 numbers are found)\n- Validation that the result is non-negative\n- Better number extraction (using regex to handle edge cases)\n\nBut strictly speaking, for the specification as written with the given examples, the implementation is **functionally correct**.\n\n**Verdict**: NO ISSUES FOUND (for the given specification and examples, though the code could be more robust).",
