      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect interpretation of \"more than 1 duplicate\"**: The specification states \"If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, return False.\" This means if a number appears MORE THAN TWICE (i.e., 3 or more times), return False. However, the current implementation checks `if count > 2`, which correctly identifies numbers appearing 3+ times. But the phrasing \"more than 1 duplicate\" is ambiguous - it could mean:\n   - More than 1 copy beyond the original (i.e., 3+ total occurrences) \u2713 Current implementation\n   - More than 1 occurrence total (i.e., 2+ occurrences) \u2717 \n\n   Looking at the examples:\n   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) \u279e True` - numbers appear exactly twice (1 duplicate each) \u2192 True\n   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) \u279e False` - number 2 appears three times (2 duplicates) \u2192 False\n\n   The examples confirm that \"more than 1 duplicate\" means more than 2 total occurrences. The current implementation with `count > 2` is **CORRECT** for this interpretation.\n\n2. **Edge case not explicitly handled but works correctly**: Empty list `[]` would return `True` due to the `len(lst) <= 1` check, which seems reasonable given the specification.\n\nAfter careful analysis of the examples provided in the docstring, the implementation appears to be correct. The logic properly:\n- Handles single-element and empty lists\n- Checks ascending order\n- Allows numbers to appear at most twice (exactly 1 duplicate)\n- Rejects numbers appearing 3 or more times (more than 1 duplicate)\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly matches the specification and all provided examples.",
