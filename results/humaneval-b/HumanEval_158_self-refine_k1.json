      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of empty list**: The function returns an empty string `\"\"` when the input list is empty, but the docstring doesn't specify this behavior. More importantly, the docstring examples suggest the function expects non-empty lists. However, this is a minor issue as the behavior is reasonable.\n\n2. **Critical bug in the third example**: The docstring shows `find_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\" ,\"cc\"]) == \"\"aaaaaaa\"` with double quotes at the beginning (`\"\"`), which appears to be a typo in the specification. The expected result should be `\"aaaaaaa\"` (single set of quotes). However, assuming this is just a documentation typo, let's verify the logic:\n   - \"aaaaaaa\" has 1 unique character\n   - \"bb\" has 1 unique character  \n   - \"cc\" has 1 unique character\n   \n   When all have the same number of unique characters, the function should return the lexicographically first one, which would be \"aaaaaaa\" (comes before \"bb\" and \"cc\"). The implementation correctly handles this.\n\n3. **Logic verification for the examples**:\n   - Example 1: \"name\" (4 unique), \"of\" (2 unique), \"string\" (6 unique) \u2192 \"string\" \u2713\n   - Example 2: \"name\" (4 unique), \"enam\" (4 unique), \"game\" (4 unique) \u2192 lexicographically first is \"enam\" \u2713\n   - Example 3: All have 1 unique character \u2192 \"aaaaaaa\" is lexicographically first \u2713\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND** in the implementation logic itself. The code correctly:\n- Handles empty lists\n- Counts unique characters using `set()`\n- Uses `min()` with a tuple key that prioritizes negative unique count (for maximum) and then lexicographical order\n- Returns the correct word according to the specification\n\nThe implementation is correct assuming the double quote in example 3 is a typo in the docstring.",
