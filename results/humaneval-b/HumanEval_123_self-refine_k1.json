The code then appends 1 to the list, which is correct. However, this is actually handled correctly, so this is not an issue.\n\n2. **Incorrect handling when n=1**: Actually, upon closer inspection, when `n=1`, the loop doesn't execute (since `current` starts at 1), and then 1 is appended once. This gives `[1]`, which matches the specification. So this is correct.\n\nLet me trace through the example:\n- n=5: current=5 (odd, append 5), current=16, current=8, current=4, current=2, current=1 (exit loop), append 1 \u2192 [5, 1] \u2192 sorted: [1, 5] \u2713\n\nLet me check edge cases:\n- n=1: current=1, loop doesn't run, append 1 \u2192 [1] \u2713\n- n=2: current=2 (even), current=1 (exit loop), append 1 \u2192 [1] \u2713\n- n=3: current=3 (odd, append 3), current=10, current=5 (odd, append 5), current=16, current=8, current=4, current=2, current=1 (exit loop), append 1 \u2192 [3, 5, 1] \u2192 sorted: [1, 3, 5] \u2713\n\nThe logic appears sound. The code correctly:\n- Collects odd numbers during the sequence\n- Stops when reaching 1\n- Adds 1 to the list (since 1 is odd and always the final term)\n- Returns a sorted list\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND",
