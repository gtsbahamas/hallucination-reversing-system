After each iteration:\n   - `a` should hold fibfib(i-3)\n   - `b` should hold fibfib(i-2)\n   - `c` should hold fibfib(i-1)\n   \n   But with the current assignment, after the first iteration when i=3:\n   - `a = 0` (was b, which is fibfib(1))\n   - `b = 1` (was c, which is fibfib(2))\n   - `c = 1` (should be fibfib(3) = 0+0+1 = 1) \u2713\n   \n   After the second iteration when i=4:\n   - `a = 1` (was b, which is fibfib(2))\n   - `b = 1` (was c, which is fibfib(3))\n   - `c = 2` (computes 0+1+1 = 2, but should be fibfib(4) = fibfib(3)+fibfib(2)+fibfib(1) = 1+1+0 = 2) \u2713\n   \n   Actually, let me verify with fibfib(5):\n   - Initial: a=0, b=0, c=1\n   - i=3: a=0, b=1, c=1 (fibfib(3)=1)\n   - i=4: a=1, b=1, c=2 (fibfib(4)=2)\n   - i=5: a=1, b=2, c=4 (fibfib(5)=4) \u2713\n   \n   The code actually appears correct upon closer inspection. The simultaneous assignment properly maintains the sliding window.\n\nLet me re-verify the logic is correct by tracing through:\n- fibfib(0)=0, fibfib(1)=0, fibfib(2)=1\n- fibfib(3)=0+0+1=1\n- fibfib(4)=1+0+1=2  \n- fibfib(5)=2+1+1=4 \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly handles the base cases and uses an efficient iterative approach with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. The simultaneous assignment `a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c` properly maintains the sliding window of three consecutive values needed for the recurrence relation.",
