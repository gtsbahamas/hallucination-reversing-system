      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of duplicate smallest even values**: The current implementation does not properly handle the case where multiple nodes have the same smallest even value. According to the specification, \"If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\"\n\n   The bug is in this condition:\n   ```python\n   if smallest_even is None or value < smallest_even:\n   ```\n   \n   This only updates when a **strictly smaller** value is found. When a duplicate smallest even value appears later in the array, it won't update because `value < smallest_even` is false (they're equal).\n   \n   **Fix**: Change the condition to:\n   ```python\n   if smallest_even is None or value <= smallest_even:\n   ```\n   \n   Wait, that's also wrong - it would keep updating to later indices with the same value.\n   \n   **Correct Fix**: The original logic `value < smallest_even` is actually correct! When we find the first occurrence of the smallest even value, we store it. Later occurrences of the same value won't satisfy `value < smallest_even`, so we keep the first index. \n\nLet me reconsider...\n\nActually, **NO ISSUES FOUND**.\n\nThe implementation is correct:\n- When the first smallest even value is found, it's stored along with its index\n- When a duplicate of that smallest value appears later, the condition `value < smallest_even` evaluates to `False` (since they're equal, not less than)\n- Therefore, the index is NOT updated, preserving the smallest index\n- Example 4 works correctly: when 0 is found at index 1, it's stored. When 0 appears again at index 3, the condition `0 < 0` is false, so index 1 is preserved\n\nThe code correctly handles all specified requirements including empty arrays, no even values, and duplicate smallest even values.",
