      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: None - the implementation is actually correct!\n\n**Analysis**: \nThe judge assessment shows all claims passing. The initial \"FAIL\" verdict was reconsidered and changed to \"PASS\" upon closer examination. The implementation correctly:\n\n1. **Triangle validity check** (line 11): Uses `<=` which is correct because:\n   - The spec requires \"sum of any two sides is **greater than** the third side\" (strict inequality)\n   - The code returns -1 when `a + b <= c` (i.e., when a + b is NOT greater than c)\n   - This correctly rejects both invalid triangles AND degenerate triangles (where sum equals the third side)\n\n2. **Heron's formula** (lines 14-16): Correctly implemented\n   - Semi-perimeter: `s = (a + b + c) / 2`\n   - Area: `sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))`\n\n3. **Rounding** (line 18): Correctly rounds to 2 decimal places\n\n4. **Test cases**: Both examples pass correctly\n\n**Conclusion**: No changes needed. The function works as specified.",
