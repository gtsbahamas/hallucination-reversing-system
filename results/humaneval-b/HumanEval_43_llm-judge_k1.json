      "remediation": "The current implementation is **already correct** according to the judge assessment - all test cases pass. However, let me verify against the specification:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. \u2705 Finds pairs that sum to zero (e.g., `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]` returns `True` for -5 and 5)\n2. \u2705 Ensures distinct elements (checks `-num in seen` BEFORE adding `num`)\n3. \u2705 Handles edge cases (single element, zero)\n4. \u2705 Returns `False` when no pairs exist\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No fix needed.** The implementation is correct as-is.\n\nThe algorithm works by:\n- Iterating through each number\n- Checking if its negation exists in previously seen numbers\n- Only adding the current number to `seen` after the check (ensuring distinctness)\n- Returning `True` immediately when a pair is found, or `False` if none exist\n\nThis is an optimal O(n) time, O(n) space solution that correctly implements the specification.",
