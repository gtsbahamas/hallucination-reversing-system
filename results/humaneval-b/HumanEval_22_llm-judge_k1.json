      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **no fix is needed**. All claims pass successfully.\n\nThe current implementation is correct:\n\n```python\nreturn [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int) and not isinstance(x, bool)]\n```\n\n**Why this implementation is correct:**\n\n1. **`isinstance(x, int)`** - Filters for integer types, excluding strings, floats, dicts, lists, etc.\n\n2. **`and not isinstance(x, bool)`** - Critical addition because in Python, `bool` is a subclass of `int`. Without this check, `True` and `False` would be included in the results since `isinstance(True, int)` returns `True`.\n\n3. Both doctest examples pass:\n   - `['a', 3.14, 5]` \u2192 `[5]` \u2713\n   - `[1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]` \u2192 `[1, 2, 3]` \u2713\n\n**Conclusion:** The function is already correctly implemented.
