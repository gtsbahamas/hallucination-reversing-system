      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of zero**: The specification states \"Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers\", which means we should ignore negative numbers but NOT zero. Zero is neither positive nor negative, and it's an integer. However, the current implementation uses `num_int > 0`, which excludes zero. According to the examples, `double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10`, zero contributes 0 to the sum (0\u00b2 = 0), but it should still be processed. The condition should be `num_int >= 0` instead of `num_int > 0`. \n\n   **However**, upon closer inspection of the specification \"sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are odd\", zero is not odd (0 % 2 == 0), so it would be filtered out by the `num_int % 2 == 1` check anyway. So this is actually not a bug - the `> 0` correctly excludes negatives, and the odd check excludes zero.\n\n2. **Actually, re-reading issue #1**: The logic is correct. The function should only sum squares of ODD numbers that are non-negative integers. Zero is even, so it won't be included. Negative numbers are excluded by `> 0`. This is working as intended.\n\nLet me verify against the examples:\n- `[1, 3, 2, 0]`: 1 is odd (1\u00b2=1), 3 is odd (3\u00b2=9), 2 is even (skip), 0 is even (skip) \u2192 1+9=10 \u2713\n- `[-1, -2, 0]`: -1 is negative (skip), -2 is negative (skip), 0 is even (skip) \u2192 0 \u2713\n- `[9, -2]`: 9 is odd (9\u00b2=81), -2 is negative (skip) \u2192 81 \u2713\n- `[0]`: 0 is even (skip) \u2192 0 \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Handles empty lists (returns 0)\n- Filters out negative numbers\n- Filters out non-integers (floats with decimal parts)\n- Only sums squares of odd positive integers\n- Accepts floats that represent whole numbers (e.g., 3.0)",
