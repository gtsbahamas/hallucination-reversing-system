For example, the closed interval [2, 3] contains the elements {2, 3}, which has length 2, not 1.\n\n   **Fix**: Change `length = end - start` to `length = end - start + 1`\n\n2. **Verification with provided examples**:\n   - `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))`: Intersection is [2, 2], which has length 1 (not prime) \u2713\n   - `intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))`: Intersection is [0, 1], which has length 2 (prime), but expected output is \"NO\" \u2717\n   - `intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))`: Intersection is [-3, -1], which has length 3 (prime), expected output is \"YES\" \u2713\n\n   With the current code (using `end - start`):\n   - Example 1: length = 2 - 2 = 0 \u2192 \"NO\" \u2713\n   - Example 2: length = 1 - 0 = 1 \u2192 \"NO\" \u2713\n   - Example 3: length = -1 - (-3) = 2 \u2192 \"YES\" \u2713\n\n   So the examples actually confirm that the intended formula is `end - start`, NOT `end - start + 1`. This means the docstring's definition of \"length\" is the difference between endpoints, not the count of integers in the interval.\n\n3. **Re-evaluation**: Given that the examples work with `end - start`, the current implementation is actually correct according to the specification as demonstrated by the examples. The term \"length\" here means the numerical difference, not the count of elements.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly matches the specification as defined by the provided examples. The \"length\" of an intersection refers to the numerical difference between the end and start points, not the count of integers contained in the interval.",
