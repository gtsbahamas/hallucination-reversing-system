      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Edge case: Empty string not handled properly**\n   - If `paren_string` is an empty string `\"\"`, `split()` returns `[]`, which correctly returns `[]`. However, if the string contains only whitespace, `split()` also returns `[]`, which may or may not be the intended behavior depending on specification.\n\n2. **Edge case: String with only spaces**\n   - Input like `\"   \"` would return `[]` rather than potentially returning a list with zeros or raising an error. The specification doesn't clarify this case.\n\n3. **No validation of balanced parentheses**\n   - The function doesn't validate that parentheses are properly balanced. For example, `\"(()\"` would return `[2]` even though it's malformed, and `\"())\"` would return `[1]` despite having an extra closing parenthesis. After processing, `current_depth` could be negative or non-zero, but this is never checked.\n\n4. **No handling of invalid characters**\n   - The function silently ignores any characters that aren't `(` or `)`. For example, `\"(a(b))\"` would be processed as if it were `\"(())\"` and return `[2]`. Depending on the specification, this might be incorrect behavior - invalid characters should potentially raise an error or be handled explicitly.\n\n**Recommendation**: If the specification guarantees well-formed input (balanced parentheses with no invalid characters), then the current implementation is correct for the happy path. However, for robustness, consider adding validation:\n- Check that `current_depth` returns to 0 at the end of each group\n- Check that `current_depth` never goes negative\n- Optionally validate that groups contain only `(` and `)` characters\n\nIf the specification guarantees valid input, then: **NO ISSUES FOUND** for the core logic with valid inputs.",
