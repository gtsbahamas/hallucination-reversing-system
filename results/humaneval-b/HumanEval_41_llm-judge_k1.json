All test claims pass.\n\nHowever, if you're seeing failures in practice, here are potential issues to verify:\n\n## Potential Issues & Fixes\n\n### 1. **Edge Case: n = 0**\n- **Current behavior**: Returns `0 * 0 = 0` \u2713 (correct)\n- **No fix needed**\n\n### 2. **Type Handling**\nIf the function receives invalid input types:\n- **Fix**: Add input validation\n  ```python\n  if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n      raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n  ```\n\n### 3. **Integer Overflow (for very large n)**\n- **Current**: Python handles arbitrary precision integers natively\n- **No fix needed** for Python\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No changes required** - the implementation `return n * n` is mathematically and logically correct:\n- Each of n left-to-right cars collides with each of n right-to-left cars\n- Total collisions = n \u00d7 n\n\nIf you're experiencing test failures, the issue likely lies in:\n1. Test expectations being incorrect\n2. Input format/parsing issues\n3. External constraints not mentioned in the specification\n\nThe core logic is sound.",
