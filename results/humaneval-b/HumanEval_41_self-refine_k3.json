Here's why:\n\n**Logic Analysis:**\n- Each of the n left-to-right cars will collide with each of the n right-to-left cars exactly once\n- Since cars pass through each other (infinitely sturdy), all n\u00b2 pairwise collisions will occur\n- The formula n \u00d7 n correctly counts all possible collision pairs\n\n**Edge Cases Handled:**\n- n = 0: Returns 0 (no cars, no collisions) \u2713\n- n = 1: Returns 1 (one collision between the two cars) \u2713\n- n > 1: Returns n\u00b2 (all pairwise collisions) \u2713\n\n**Assumptions Validated:**\n- The problem states cars start \"very far from each other\" and move at the same speed, ensuring all cars will eventually meet\n- The infinite sturdiness means no car stops or changes direction, so all collision pairs are realized\n- The straight infinite road ensures no geometric constraints prevent collisions\n\nThe implementation correctly returns n\u00b2 as the total number of collisions.",
