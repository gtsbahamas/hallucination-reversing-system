However, the docstring examples suggest a different interpretation:\n   - In `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]` \u2192 `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`\n   - Indices 0, 3, 6 have values [5, 4, 2] which become [2, 4, 5] when sorted\n   - The result shows indices 0\u21922, 3\u21924, 6\u21925\n   \n   Wait, let me recalculate: indices 0, 3, 6 contain [5, 4, 2]. Sorted: [2, 4, 5]. Placing back: index 0\u21922, index 3\u21924, index 6\u21925. This matches the expected output `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.\n\n2. **Actually, the implementation is CORRECT** for the given examples. Let me verify:\n   - Example 1: `[1, 2, 3]` - indices divisible by 3 are [0]. Values: [1]. Sorted: [1]. Result: `[1, 2, 3]` \u2713\n   - Example 2: `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]` - indices divisible by 3 are [0, 3, 6]. Values: [5, 4, 2]. Sorted: [2, 4, 5]. Result: `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]` \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Handles empty lists\n- Extracts elements at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, ... (indices divisible by 3)\n- Sorts those elements\n- Places them back at their respective indices\n- Preserves all other elements at their original positions",
