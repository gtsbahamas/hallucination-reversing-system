      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Integer division inconsistency**: The specification states `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` for even n, which suggests regular division (potentially returning a float). However, the implementation uses `i // 2` (integer division). Looking at the examples:\n   - `tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2` \u2713 (both divisions give 2)\n   - `tri(4) = 3` means `1 + 4/2 = 3` \u2713 (both divisions give 2)\n   \n   While this works for the given examples, if the specification truly means regular division, this could cause issues. However, given the examples all result in integers, integer division appears correct. This is more of an ambiguity in the spec than a bug.\n\n2. **Missing edge case for n=1**: When `n=1`, the function should return `[1, 3]` (the first 2 numbers: tri(0) and tri(1)). The current implementation handles this correctly since the loop `range(2, n+1)` becomes `range(2, 2)` which is empty, so it returns `[1, 3]`. This is actually correct.\n\n3. **No actual issues with the logic**: The implementation correctly:\n   - Handles the base case n=0\n   - Computes even indices using the formula\n   - Computes odd indices by calculating tri(i+1) on-the-fly since i+1 is even\n   - Returns a list of n+1 elements\n\nLet me verify with the example:\n- `tri(3)` should return `[1, 3, 2, 8]`\n- i=2 (even): `1 + 2//2 = 2` \u2192 `[1, 3, 2]`\n- i=3 (odd): `tri_next = 1 + 4//2 = 3`, `result = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8` \u2192 `[1, 3, 2, 8]` \u2713\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly follows the specification and handles all edge cases properly.",
