But the logic of \"making the first digit negative\" is conceptually flawed for understanding what \"sum of digits\" means for negative numbers.\n\n2. **The `sorted()` function is stable by default**, so the note about maintaining original order for equal sums is actually handled correctly by Python's sort. This part works as intended.\n\n**Verification of the logic:**\nActually, upon closer inspection, let me verify the example:\n- `-1`: sum = -1 \u2713\n- `-11`: sum = -1 + 1 = 0 \u2713\n- `1`: sum = 1 \u2713\n- `-12`: sum = -1 + 2 = 1 \u2713\n- `11`: sum = 1 + 1 = 2 \u2713\n\nExpected: `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]` with sums `[-1, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n\nThe implementation would produce this correct order, so the logic is actually correct!\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly handles:\n- Empty lists\n- Positive numbers (sum all digits)\n- Negative numbers (first digit is negative, rest are positive)\n- Stable sorting (maintains original order for equal sums)\n- The example test case produces the expected output",
