However, '7' doesn't appear in 0, so this doesn't affect the count but is technically correct behavior.\n\n- **Numbers divisible by both 11 and 13**: Numbers like 143 (11 \u00d7 13) are only counted once due to the `or` operator, which is correct.\n\n- **Multi-digit 7s**: The `str(i).count('7')` correctly counts multiple occurrences of '7' in a number (e.g., 77 counts as 2).\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly matches the specification and handles all test cases and edge cases appropriately.",
