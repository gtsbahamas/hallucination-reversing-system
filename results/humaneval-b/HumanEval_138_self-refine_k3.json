The minimum sum is 8 (2+2+2+2), and the next possible sum would be 10 (2+2+2+4), which works. Actually, wait - let me reconsider: 2+2+2+4 = 10, so this does work. Let me verify the examples more carefully.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, let me trace through the examples:\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)`: 4 is even and 4 < 8, returns `False` \u2713\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)`: 6 is even and 6 < 8, returns `False` \u2713  \n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)`: 8 is even and 8 >= 8, returns `True` \u2713 (2+2+2+2=8)\n\nLet me verify if all even numbers >= 8 can be expressed as sum of 4 positive even numbers:\n- 8 = 2+2+2+2 \u2713\n- 10 = 2+2+2+4 \u2713\n- 12 = 2+2+2+6 or 2+2+4+4 \u2713\n- 14 = 2+2+2+8 or 2+2+4+6 \u2713\n- For any even n >= 8: n = 2+2+2+(n-6), where (n-6) is even and >= 2 \u2713\n\nThe logic appears sound. Any even number n >= 8 can be written as 2+2+2+(n-6), where (n-6) is a positive even number (since n is even and n >= 8 means n-6 >= 2).\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.",
