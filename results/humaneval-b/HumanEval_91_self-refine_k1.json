      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect word boundary detection**: The condition `sentence.startswith(\"I \")` will match sentences starting with \"I\" followed by a space, but it won't match cases where \"I\" is followed by punctuation or other non-space characters. For example, \"I'm happy\" or \"I'll go\" would not be counted, even though they are sentences starting with the word \"I\". The check should verify that \"I\" is a complete word, not just a prefix.\n\n2. **The `sentence == \"I\"` check is correct but incomplete**: While checking for a standalone \"I\" is good, combined with issue #1, this doesn't fully solve the word boundary problem.\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\nReplace the word-start checking logic with a proper word boundary check:\n\n```python\nif sentence.startswith(\"I \") or sentence == \"I\" or (sentence.startswith(\"I\") and len(sentence) > 1 and not sentence[1].isalnum()):\n```\n\nOr more elegantly, use regex or split to check if the first word is exactly \"I\":\n\n```python\nwords = sentence.split()\nif words and words[0] == \"I\":\n    count += 1\n```\n\nThis ensures that \"I\" is a complete word at the start of the sentence, handling cases like:\n- \"I love this\" \u2713\n- \"I'm happy\" \u2713\n- \"I'll go\" \u2713\n- \"Ice cream\" \u2717 (correctly rejected)\n- \"I\" \u2713",
      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The current implementation fails to recognize \"I\" as a word when it's followed by punctuation (e.g., \"I'm\", \"I'll\", \"I've\") because it only checks for \"I \" (I followed by space) or standalone \"I\".\n\n**Solution:** Use word splitting to check if the first word is exactly \"I\".\n\n**Lines to change:**\n- **Lines 18-20** (the if condition and count increment)\n\n**Specific fix:**\nReplace:\n```python\n# Check if sentence starts with \"I\" followed by a space or is just \"I\"\nif sentence.startswith(\"I \") or sentence == \"I\":\n    count += 1\n```\n\nWith:\n```python\n# Check if the first word is \"I\"\nwords = sentence.split()\nif words and words[0] == \"I\":\n    count += 1\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- `split()` breaks the sentence into words by whitespace, so \"I'm happy\" becomes `[\"I'm\", \"happy\"]`\n- Checking `words[0] == \"I\"` ensures we're looking at the complete first word\n- This correctly handles:\n  - \"I love this\" \u2192 first word is \"I\" \u2713\n  - \"I'm happy\" \u2192 first word is \"I'm\" (starts with \"I\" but isn't \"I\") \u2717\n  - \"I\" \u2192 first word is \"I\" \u2713\n  - \"Ice cream\" \u2192 first word is \"Ice\" \u2717\n\n**Wait - Issue with the feedback:** The feedback claims \"I'm\" should match, but per the spec, we need the word \"I\", not words starting with \"I\". The current `split()` approach correctly identifies only standalone \"I\" as the first word, which aligns with \"starts with the **word** 'I'\".\n\nIf contractions like \"I'm\" should count (ambiguous from spec), keep the original `startswith(\"I \")` approach but add a check for non-alphanumeric after \"I\".",
