The implementation correctly returns `'a'`, so this is actually correct.\n\n   However, there's ambiguity in the specification itself - it's unclear if \"the longest one\" means we should always return the first string when all are equal length, or if we should return the first occurrence of the maximum length found.\n\n2. **The implementation is actually correct**: Upon careful review, the code correctly:\n   - Returns `None` for empty lists\n   - Returns the first string when all strings have the same length (since it only updates `max_string` when `len(string) > max_length`, not `>=`)\n   - Returns the first occurrence of the longest string when there are multiple strings with the maximum length\n   - Returns the longest string when lengths differ\n\nWait, let me reconsider the docstring example:\n```python\n>>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])\n'a'\n```\n\nThis confirms that when all strings are the same length, we return the first one, which the implementation does correctly.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all cases specified in the docstring:\n- Empty list returns `None`\n- Returns the first string of maximum length\n- Uses strict inequality (`>`) to ensure the first occurrence is kept when multiple strings have the same maximum length",
