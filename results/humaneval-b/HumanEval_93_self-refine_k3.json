The implementation correctly handles spaces by keeping them as-is in the `else` branch, but this contradicts the \"Assume only letters\" statement. However, based on the examples, the implementation is correct - this is more of a docstring ambiguity than a code bug.\n\n2. **Logic order issue with vowel replacement and case swapping**: The function swaps the case AFTER replacing the vowel, but according to the specification, it should:\n   - First swap the case of ALL letters (including vowels)\n   - Then replace vowels with letters 2 places ahead\n   \n   Let's trace through 'test':\n   - 't' \u2192 swap case \u2192 'T'\n   - 'e' \u2192 swap case \u2192 'E', then replace with letter 2 ahead \u2192 'G'\n   - 's' \u2192 swap case \u2192 'S'\n   - 't' \u2192 swap case \u2192 'T'\n   - Expected: 'TGST' \u2713\n   \n   Actually, looking more carefully at the examples, the current implementation produces the correct output. Let me re-analyze:\n   \n   For 'e' (lowercase):\n   - Current code: replaces with 'g', then swaps to 'G' (uppercase)\n   - This matches the expected output\n   \n   For 'E' (uppercase):\n   - Current code: replaces with 'g', then swaps to 'g' (lowercase)\n   - In 'This is a message': 'E' should become 'g' (lowercase)\n   \n   The implementation appears correct for the given examples.\n\nActually, upon careful review and tracing through both examples:\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. Swaps case of all letters (consonants directly, vowels after replacement)\n2. Replaces vowels with letters 2 places ahead in the alphabet\n3. Handles non-letter characters (spaces) by keeping them unchanged\n4. Produces the expected output for both test cases",
