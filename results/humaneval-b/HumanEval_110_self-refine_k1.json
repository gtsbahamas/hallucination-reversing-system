Let me verify the logic:\n\n**Correctness Analysis:**\n\n1. **Core Logic**: The function correctly identifies that to make lst1 contain only even numbers, we need at least `len(lst1)` even numbers available across both lists combined.\n\n2. **Counting**: The even number counting is correct using `num % 2 == 0`.\n\n3. **Exchange Mechanism**: Since there's no limit on exchanges, we can:\n   - Keep all even numbers currently in lst1\n   - Exchange all odd numbers in lst1 with even numbers from lst2\n   - This works as long as total even numbers \u2265 len(lst1)\n\n4. **Example Verification**:\n   - `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`: 2 + 2 = 4 \u2265 4 \u2192 \"YES\" \u2713\n   - `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`: 2 + 1 = 3 < 4 \u2192 \"NO\" \u2713\n\n5. **Edge Cases Handled**:\n   - All even in lst1: Works (total_even \u2265 len(lst1))\n   - All odd in lst1: Works if lst2 has enough evens\n   - Empty lists: Covered by assumption (non-empty)\n\nThe implementation is efficient (O(n + m)) and correctly solves the problem.",
