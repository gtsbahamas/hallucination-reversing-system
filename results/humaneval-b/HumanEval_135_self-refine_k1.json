      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect interpretation of the specification**: The docstring states \"not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it\", which means `arr[i] <= arr[i-1]`. However, the implementation only checks `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` (strictly less than). \n\n   According to the specification, an element that is equal to its predecessor should also qualify. However, the docstring also states \"The given array will not contain duplicate values,\" which means equality will never occur. So while this isn't technically a bug given the constraint, the condition should ideally match the specification for clarity and correctness in general cases.\n\n2. **Actually, upon closer reading**: The specification says \"not greater than or equal to\" which is the negation of \"greater than or equal to\". Let me parse this carefully:\n   - \"greater than or equal to\" means `arr[i] >= arr[i-1]`\n   - \"NOT greater than or equal to\" means `NOT (arr[i] >= arr[i-1])`, which is equivalent to `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`\n\n   So the implementation is actually **correct** in using `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`.\n\nLet me verify with the examples:\n- `can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5])`: At index 3, arr[3]=3 and arr[2]=4, so 3 < 4 is true. This should return 3. \u2713\n- `can_arrange([1,2,3])`: All elements satisfy arr[i] >= arr[i-1], so no element is \"not greater than or equal to\" its predecessor. Should return -1. \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly identifies elements where `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` (i.e., not greater than or equal to the preceding element) and returns the largest such index, or -1 if none exist.",
