The formula seems correct.\n\n3. **Re-examining the entire logic:**\n   - For n=2:\n     - Start with 1: 10, 11, 12, ..., 19 = 10 numbers\n     - End with 1: 11, 21, 31, ..., 91 = 9 numbers\n     - Both: 11 = 1 number\n     - Total: 10 + 9 - 1 = 18 \u2713\n   \n   - For n=3:\n     - Start with 1: 100-199 = 100 numbers\n     - End with 1: _01, _11, _21, ..., _91 where first digit is 1-9 = 9 \u00d7 10 = 90 numbers\n     - Both: 101, 111, 121, ..., 191 = 10 numbers\n     - Total: 100 + 90 - 10 = 180 \u2713\n\nThe logic appears correct upon careful analysis.\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND\n\nThe implementation correctly handles the inclusion-exclusion principle for counting n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, including the special case when n=1.",
