However, this behavior should be verified as intentional since it's not explicitly documented in the docstring.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, let me reconsider:\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation is correct:\n\n1. **Handles edge cases properly**: \n   - Empty list `[]` \u2192 returns `[]` (derivative of 0 is 0)\n   - Single element `[c]` \u2192 returns `[]` (derivative of constant is 0)\n\n2. **Correct derivative calculation**: For a polynomial `xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + ... + xs[n]*x^n`, the derivative is `xs[1] + 2*xs[2]*x + 3*xs[3]*x^2 + ... + n*xs[n]*x^(n-1)`, which translates to coefficients `[xs[1]*1, xs[2]*2, xs[3]*3, ..., xs[n]*n]`.\n\n3. **Matches the examples**:\n   - `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` = `[1*1, 2*2, 4*3, 5*4]` = `[1, 4, 12, 20]` \u2713\n   - `derivative([1, 2, 3])` = `[2*1, 3*2]` = `[2, 6]` \u2713\n\nThe implementation correctly computes the derivative by multiplying each coefficient by its power and shifting indices appropriately.",
