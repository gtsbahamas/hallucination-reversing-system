      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of non-alphabetic characters**: The function converts the entire string to lowercase using `string.lower()`, but this only affects alphabetic characters. Non-alphabetic characters (digits, punctuation, spaces, etc.) are treated as distinct from each other even when they should be counted as-is. While this isn't necessarily wrong for non-alphabetic characters, the specification says \"regardless of case\" which implies case-insensitivity should only apply to characters that have case (letters). However, the current implementation actually handles this correctly since `lower()` only affects letters.\n\nActually, upon further review, let me reconsider:\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Converts the string to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity\n- Uses `set()` to get unique characters\n- Returns the count of distinct characters\n- Handles the test cases correctly:\n  - `'xyzXYZ'` \u2192 `'xyzxyz'` \u2192 `{'x', 'y', 'z'}` \u2192 3 \u2713\n  - `'Jerry'` \u2192 `'jerry'` \u2192 `{'j', 'e', 'r', 'y'}` \u2192 4 \u2713\n- Handles edge cases like empty strings (returns 0)\n- Properly handles non-alphabetic characters (they remain unchanged by `lower()` and are counted as distinct)",
