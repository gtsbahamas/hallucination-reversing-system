      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation **passes all test cases** according to the judge assessment. All claims are marked as \"PASS\", indicating the function correctly:\n- Handles edge cases (n < 2, n = 2)\n- Identifies even non-primes\n- Identifies odd composites\n- Identifies small, medium, and large primes\n- Uses an efficient algorithm\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix is needed.** The implementation is correct and complete.\n\nThe function properly implements trial division primality testing with all necessary optimizations:\n1. Early returns for n < 2 (non-prime)\n2. Special case for n = 2 (the only even prime)\n3. Quick check for even numbers > 2 (non-prime)\n4. Trial division by odd numbers only, up to \u221an\n\nAll test cases pass, and the algorithm is both correct and efficient.",
