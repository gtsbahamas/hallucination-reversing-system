      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of zero**: The implementation fails when the list contains multiple zeros. According to the specification, we need \"two distinct elements\" that sum to zero. Two zeros (0 + 0 = 0) at different positions should return `True`, but the current implementation will return `False` because when it encounters the first 0, `-0` (which equals `0`) is not yet in the `seen` set, and when it encounters the second 0, it will find `0` in `seen` and return `True`. Actually, wait - let me reconsider this.\n\n   Actually, the implementation WILL correctly handle `[0, 0]` and return `True` (the second 0 will find the first 0 in the set). However, looking at the first example `[1, 3, 5, 0]` which returns `False`, this suggests that a single zero should NOT count as a valid pair. The docstring says \"two distinct elements\" which could mean two different positions OR two different values. Based on the example, it appears to mean two different positions with values that sum to zero.\n\n   Let me re-examine: The implementation actually handles this correctly! When we have `[0, 0]`, the second 0 will find `-0` (which is 0) in the seen set and return True. The example `[1, 3, 5, 0]` has only one zero, so it correctly returns False.\n\n2. **Actually, NO ISSUES**: Upon careful analysis, the implementation is correct:\n   - It checks each element to see if its negative exists in previously seen elements\n   - This ensures we're checking distinct positions (we never compare an element with itself)\n   - For `[0, 0]`, it would correctly return `True` (two distinct zeros at different positions)\n   - For `[1, 3, 5, 0]`, it correctly returns `False` (only one zero)\n   - For `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]`, it correctly finds -5 and 5\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly identifies pairs of distinct elements (at different positions) that sum to zero using an efficient O(n) time complexity approach with a set for lookups.",
