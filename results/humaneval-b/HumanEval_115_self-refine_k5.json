While the constraints state `1 <= capacity <= 10`, defensive programming would suggest handling this edge case or at least validating the input.\n\n2. **Integer division edge case with `math.ceil()`**: When `water_units` is 0, `math.ceil(0 / capacity)` correctly returns 0. However, the code could be more efficient by checking if `water_units == 0` before performing the division and ceiling operation, though this is a minor optimization rather than a bug.\n\n3. **No input validation**: The function doesn't validate that:\n   - `grid` is not empty\n   - `capacity` is positive\n   - Grid elements are actually 0 or 1\n   \n   While the constraints guarantee these conditions, the function could be more robust.\n\n**However**, for the given constraints and specification, the core logic is **correct**. The function properly:\n- Iterates through each well (row)\n- Counts water units using `sum(row)`\n- Calculates trips needed using `math.ceil(water_units / capacity)`\n- Accumulates the total trips\n- Returns the correct result for all provided examples\n\nIf we assume the constraints are always met (as is typical in competitive programming), then:\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND** - the implementation correctly matches the specification for all valid inputs within the stated constraints.",
