Uses nested loops to compare each pair of numbers exactly once (avoiding duplicate comparisons and self-comparisons)\n2. Calculates the absolute difference between each pair\n3. Returns `True` immediately when a pair is found with distance less than the threshold\n4. Returns `False` if no such pair exists after checking all combinations\n\nThe implementation correctly handles the test cases:\n- `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` with threshold `0.5`: All consecutive differences are 1.0, which is \u2265 0.5, so returns `False`\n- `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` with threshold `0.3`: The pair (2.8, 3.0) has difference 0.2 < 0.3, so returns `True`",
