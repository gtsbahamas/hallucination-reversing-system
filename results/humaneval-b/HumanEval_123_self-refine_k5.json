However, it doesn't check if any odd numbers appear in the sequence between this step and when we reach 1. The issue is that after computing `3 * current + 1` (which is always even), the code continues to the next iteration where it will only divide by 2. This means we might skip odd numbers that appear later in the sequence through the division process.\n\n   **Example**: For `n = 5`:\n   - Start: 5 (odd) \u2192 append 5, compute 3*5+1 = 16\n   - 16 (even) \u2192 16//2 = 8\n   - 8 (even) \u2192 8//2 = 4\n   - 4 (even) \u2192 4//2 = 2\n   - 2 (even) \u2192 2//2 = 1\n   - Exit loop, append 1\n   - Result: [1, 5] \u2713 (This works correctly)\n\n   But for `n = 3`:\n   - Start: 3 (odd) \u2192 append 3, compute 3*3+1 = 10\n   - 10 (even) \u2192 10//2 = 5\n   - 5 (even check fails, so it's odd) \u2192 append 5, compute 3*5+1 = 16\n   - ... continues\n   - This actually works correctly too.\n\n   **Actually, upon closer inspection, the logic is correct.** The while loop continues until `current == 1`, and at each iteration it checks if the current number is odd before processing it. So all odd numbers in the sequence will be captured.\n\nLet me trace through more carefully:\n\nFor n=5: [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]\n- current=5 (odd) \u2192 append 5, current=16\n- current=16 (even) \u2192 current=8\n- current=8 (even) \u2192 current=4\n- current=4 (even) \u2192 current=2\n- current=2 (even) \u2192 current=1\n- Exit loop, append 1\n- Result: [1, 5] \u2713\n\nThe code appears correct!\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND",
