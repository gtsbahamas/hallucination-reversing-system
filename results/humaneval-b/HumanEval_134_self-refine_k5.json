A single character without any spaces could be considered a word itself, not a standalone letter. However, this interpretation is ambiguous from the examples given.\n\n2. **Main logic error - doesn't check if last char is followed by non-letter**: The function only checks if the character *before* the last character is a space, but doesn't verify that the last character isn't part of a word. According to the definition \"not a part of a word\", we need to ensure:\n   - The last character is alphabetical\n   - There's a space before it (or it's at the start)\n   - There's NO alphabetical character after it (which is guaranteed since it's the last char)\n   - BUT we also need to ensure it's truly standalone\n\n   Actually, re-reading the spec: the current logic seems mostly correct for the given examples.\n\n3. **Edge case: Single letter after space is handled correctly** - This actually works fine with the current implementation.\n\nWait, let me reconsider by tracing through the examples:\n- `\"apple pie\"`: last='e', txt[-2]='i', 'i'!=' ' \u2192 False \u2713\n- `\"apple pi e\"`: last='e', txt[-2]=' ' \u2192 True \u2713\n- `\"apple pi e \"`: last=' ', not alpha \u2192 False \u2713\n- `\"\"`: len=0 \u2192 False \u2713\n- `\"a\"`: len=1, 'a'.isalpha() \u2192 True (this seems correct - single letter is standalone)\n\nActually, upon careful review:\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound:\n- Returns False for empty strings\n- Returns False if last character is not alphabetical\n- Returns True for single alphabetical characters (standalone by definition)\n- Returns True only if the last character is alphabetical AND preceded by a space (ensuring it's not part of a word)",
