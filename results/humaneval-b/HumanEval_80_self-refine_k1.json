However, based on the examples, the specification actually means that **no two adjacent characters should be the same**.\n   \n   Evidence from examples:\n   - `is_happy(\"aabb\")` => False: This has adjacent duplicates ('aa' and 'bb')\n   - `is_happy(\"xyy\")` => False: This has adjacent duplicates ('yy')\n   - `is_happy(\"abcd\")` => True: No adjacent duplicates\n   - `is_happy(\"adb\")` => True: No adjacent duplicates\n   \n   The current implementation would incorrectly return True for strings like \"aba\" (where 'a' repeats but not adjacently), but the specification seems to require checking that within any 3-character window, all characters are distinct.\n   \n   Actually, re-examining: \"adb\" has length 3 and all characters are distinct, which passes. \"abcd\" checking windows \"abc\" (all distinct) and \"bcd\" (all distinct) passes. \"aabb\" checking \"aab\" (has duplicate 'a') fails correctly. \"xyy\" checking \"xyy\" (has duplicate 'y') fails correctly.\n   \n   Wait, let me reconsider with \"aba\": The window \"aba\" has characters ['a', 'b', 'a'], and `set(['a', 'b', 'a'])` = {'a', 'b'} with length 2, not 3, so it would return False. This seems correct based on the specification.\n\nActually, upon closer examination, the implementation appears correct. Let me verify each example:\n- `is_happy(\"a\")`: len < 3, returns False \u2713\n- `is_happy(\"aa\")`: len < 3, returns False \u2713\n- `is_happy(\"abcd\")`: windows \"abc\" (3 distinct), \"bcd\" (3 distinct), returns True \u2713\n- `is_happy(\"aabb\")`: window \"aab\" has set size 2, returns False \u2713\n- `is_happy(\"adb\")`: window \"adb\" (3 distinct), returns True \u2713\n- `is_happy(\"xyy\")`: window \"xyy\" has set size 2, returns False \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.",
