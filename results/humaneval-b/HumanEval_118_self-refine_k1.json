      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect iteration range**: The function uses `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` which stops at index 1 (exclusive), meaning it never checks index 1. This misses valid vowels at position 1 that are between consonants at positions 0 and 2.\n\n   **Example where this fails**: `get_closest_vowel(\"bac\")` should return \"a\" (vowel at index 1 between consonants 'b' and 'c'), but the current code returns \"\" because the loop never reaches index 1.\n\n   **Fix**: Change the range to `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` should be `range(len(word) - 2, -1, -1)` or more clearly `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` needs to stop at 0 (exclusive), so it should be `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` which actually stops at 1. The correct range should be `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` but checking the boundary: we want to check indices from `len(word)-2` down to `1` (inclusive). The current code stops at index 1 (since range's stop is exclusive), so it actually checks down to index 1. Let me reconsider...\n\n   Actually, `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` generates indices from `len(word)-2` down to `1` (inclusive), which is correct. However, let me verify with the examples again.\n\n   Wait, I need to reconsider. `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` with `len(word) = 3` gives `range(1, 0, -1)` which produces `[1]`. This is correct - it checks index 1.\n\n   Actually, upon closer inspection, the range is correct. Let me look for other issues.\n\n2. **Actually, the code appears correct**. Let me trace through the examples:\n   - \"yogurt\" (len=6): checks indices 4,3,2,1 \u2192 finds 'u' at index 4 between 'g' and 'r' \u2713\n   - \"FULL\" (len=4): checks indices 2,1 \u2192 finds 'U' at index 2 between 'F' and 'L' \u2713\n   - \"quick\" (len=5): checks indices 3,2,1 \u2192 'c' not vowel, 'i' at index 2 but between 'u'(vowel) and 'c', 'u' at index 1 but between 'q' and 'i'(vowel) \u2192 returns \"\" \u2713\n   - \"ab\" (len=2): returns \"\" immediately \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all the specified requirements and test cases.",
