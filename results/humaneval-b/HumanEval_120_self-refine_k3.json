However, looking at Example 1 more carefully: the input is [-3, -4, 5] and output is [-4, -3, 5], which is in ascending order. But this contradicts the requirement to return \"the maximum k numbers\" - the function should preserve the relative order of these maximum numbers as they appear in the original array, not sort them.\n\n   Wait, re-examining Example 1: [-3, -4, 5] \u2192 [-4, -3, 5]. This IS sorted in ascending order. Let me check Example 2: [4, -4, 4] \u2192 [4, 4]. The two 4's are returned, which are the maximum values.\n\n   Actually, upon closer inspection, the examples show the output IS sorted in ascending order, so the current implementation appears correct for the given examples.\n\n2. **Edge case verification**: Let me verify the k=0 case is handled correctly - yes, it returns an empty list as expected.\n\n3. **Re-examining the examples**: All examples show outputs in ascending sorted order:\n   - Example 1: [-4, -3, 5] is sorted ascending\n   - Example 2: [4, 4] is sorted ascending  \n   - Example 3: [2] is a single element\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Handles k=0 by returning []\n- Sorts the array\n- Takes the last k elements (which are the k maximum values)\n- Returns them in sorted (ascending) order\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly matches the specification. It returns a sorted list of the maximum k numbers in ascending order, which aligns with all provided examples.",
