      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **no fix is needed**. All claims pass successfully.\n\nThe current implementation is correct:\n```python\nreturn number - int(number)\n```\n\n**Why it works:**\n- For positive numbers, `int(number)` correctly extracts the integer part (floor)\n- Subtracting it from the original number isolates the decimal part\n- The result is always in [0, 1) for positive inputs\n- Handles all edge cases (whole numbers, typical decimals) correctly\n\n**Conclusion:** The implementation satisfies the specification completely. No changes required.",
