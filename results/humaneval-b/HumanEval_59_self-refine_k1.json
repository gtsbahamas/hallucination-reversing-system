      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of the assumption \"n is not a prime\"**: The docstring states \"Assume n > 1 and is not a prime,\" but the code includes logic to handle the case where n itself is prime (the `if n > 1: largest = n` block at the end). While this makes the function more robust, it contradicts the stated assumption. However, this is actually a good thing and makes the code work correctly even if the assumption is violated.\n\n2. **Incorrect result for the first test case**: Let me trace through `largest_prime_factor(13195)`:\n   - 13195 is odd, so the while loop for factor 2 doesn't execute\n   - Check i=3: 13195 / 3 = 4398.33... (not divisible)\n   - Check i=5: 13195 / 5 = 2639, so largest=5, n=2639\n   - Continue with n=2639, i=5: 2639 / 5 = 527.8 (not divisible)\n   - Check i=7: 2639 / 7 = 377, so largest=7, n=377\n   - Continue with n=377, i=7: 377 / 7 = 53.86... (not divisible)\n   - Check i=9, 11, 13: none divide 377\n   - When i=19: 19*19 = 361 <= 377, check: 377 / 19 = 19.84... (not divisible)\n   - When i=21: 21*21 = 441 > 377, exit loop\n   - n=377 > 1, so largest = 377\n   \n   But 377 = 13 \u00d7 29, so 377 is not prime! The expected answer is 29.\n   \n   **The bug**: The loop condition `while i * i <= n` exits too early. When n=377 and i=21, we have 21\u00b2 = 441 > 377, so the loop exits. But we haven't checked i=13 yet (13 \u00d7 29 = 377). The algorithm assumes that if no factor up to \u221an is found, then n must be prime, which is correct. However, the issue is that 13 < \u221a377 \u2248 19.4, so we should have checked i=13. Let me retrace: we do check i=13 (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13...), and 377 / 13 = 29. So the algorithm should work.\n\nLet me retrace more carefully: 13195 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 29. The algorithm should find largest=29 correctly. Actually, the code appears correct for this case upon careful analysis.\n\n**Actually, NO ISSUES FOUND** - The implementation is correct. The algorithm properly finds all prime factors and returns the largest one. The final check `if n > 1` correctly handles the case where the remaining n is itself a prime factor larger than all previously found factors.",
