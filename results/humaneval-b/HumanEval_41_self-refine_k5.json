Here's why:\n\n**Logic Analysis:**\n- Each of the n left-to-right cars will collide with each of the n right-to-left cars exactly once\n- Since cars pass through each other without stopping or changing direction, every possible pair of cars (one from each set) will meet exactly once\n- This is a combinatorial problem: n choices from the left-to-right set \u00d7 n choices from the right-to-left set = n\u00b2 total collisions\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- n = 0: Returns 0 (correct - no cars means no collisions)\n- n = 1: Returns 1 (correct - one car from each direction collides once)\n- n > 1: Returns n\u00b2 (correct - all pairs collide)\n\n**Assumptions Met:**\n- The problem states cars start \"very far from each other\" and move toward each other, guaranteeing all pairs will meet\n- All cars move at the same speed, so relative positions within each group don't matter\n- Cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving, so each pair collides exactly once\n\nThe solution correctly returns n\u00b2 (or n * n) as the total number of collisions.",
