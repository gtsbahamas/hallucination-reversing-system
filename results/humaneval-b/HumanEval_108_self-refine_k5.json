Zero has a digit sum of 0, which is not > 0, so it shouldn't be counted. This is actually handled correctly.\n\n2. **Logic error in negative number handling**: The current implementation subtracts `2 * int(s[0])` from the total, but this is incorrect. \n   - For `-123`: `s = \"123\"`, `total = 1+2+3 = 6`, then `total = 6 - 2*1 = 4`\n   - But the correct sum should be: `-1 + 2 + 3 = 4` \u2713\n   \n   Wait, let me recalculate for `-11`:\n   - `s = \"11\"`, `total = 1+1 = 2`, then `total = 2 - 2*1 = 0` \u2713\n   \n   Actually, the logic appears correct. Let me verify once more with `-1`:\n   - `s = \"1\"`, `total = 1`, then `total = 1 - 2*1 = -1` \u2713\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, the implementation appears to be **correct**. The logic properly:\n- Sums all digits as positive\n- Then subtracts twice the first digit for negative numbers (removing the positive contribution and adding the negative contribution)\n- Counts only numbers with digit sum > 0\n\nLet me verify all test cases:\n- `count_nums([])` = 0 \u2713\n- `count_nums([-1, 11, -11])`: -1\u2192-1, 11\u21922, -11\u21920, count=1 \u2713  \n- `count_nums([1, 1, 2])`: 1\u21921, 1\u21921, 2\u21922, count=3 \u2713\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all cases including:\n- Empty arrays\n- Positive numbers\n- Negative numbers with proper signed digit calculation\n- Zero (edge case)\n- Single and multi-digit numbers",
