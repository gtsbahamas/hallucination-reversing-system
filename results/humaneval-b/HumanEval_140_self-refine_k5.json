The current implementation correctly handles cases with MORE than 2 spaces (3+), but the logic for exactly 2 consecutive spaces is ambiguous based on the examples provided.\n\n   Looking at the examples:\n   - Single space: replaced with `_`\n   - The example with 3 spaces: replaced with `-`\n   \n   However, the code treats 2 consecutive spaces as `__` (two underscores), which may not be the intended behavior. The specification says \"more than 2\" means use `-`, but doesn't explicitly clarify if exactly 2 spaces should be `__` or `-`.\n   \n   **Testing with the given examples:**\n   - `\" Example   3\"` has 1 space at start (becomes `_`), then 3 spaces before \"3\" (becomes `-`), resulting in `\"_Example-3\"` \u2713 Correct\n   \n   The current implementation appears to handle the given examples correctly, but the edge case of exactly 2 consecutive spaces is not covered in the examples. Based on the specification's wording (\"more than 2\"), the current behavior of converting 2 spaces to `__` seems correct.\n\n2. **Actually, upon closer review**: The implementation is correct according to the specification. The rule is:\n   - 1 or 2 consecutive spaces: replace each with `_`\n   - More than 2 consecutive spaces (3+): replace all with a single `-`\n\n   This matches all the provided examples.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all cases according to the specification and passes all provided test cases.",
