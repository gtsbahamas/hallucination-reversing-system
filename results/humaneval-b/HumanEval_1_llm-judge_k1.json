      "remediation": "Looking at the judge's assessment, all test cases are marked as PASS. However, since you're asking for a fix plan, let me analyze if there could be any edge cases or issues not covered by the judge:\n\n## Potential Issues Not Caught by Judge\n\n1. **Empty string input**: Returns `[]` (correct behavior)\n2. **Malformed input** (unbalanced parentheses): Would leave `current_group` non-empty or result in negative depth\n3. **Non-parenthesis characters**: Would be added to `current_group` without filtering\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nSince the judge passed all cases, the implementation appears correct for the specification. However, if we want to make it more robust:\n\n**Optional Enhancement (Lines 9-10):**\n- Add validation after the loop to ensure `current_group` is empty and `depth == 0`\n- This would catch malformed input where parentheses aren't properly balanced\n\n**Optional Enhancement (Line 13):**\n- Add an `elif` check to only process `(` and `)` characters, ignoring any other characters\n- Change line 13 from `if char == '(':` to remain as-is, but add `else: continue` after line 20 to skip non-parenthesis characters\n\n**Current Status:**\nThe implementation is **correct as-is** for the given specification, which assumes well-formed input. No fixes are needed unless you want to add defensive programming for edge cases not covered in the spec.\n\nIf the judge actually found failures (contradicting the PASS verdicts shown), please provide the actual failing test cases for a concrete fix.",
