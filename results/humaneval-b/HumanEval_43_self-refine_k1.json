      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of zero**: The implementation fails when the list contains two zeros (e.g., `[0, 0]`). According to the specification, two distinct elements that sum to zero should return `True`, and `0 + 0 = 0`. However, the current implementation would add the first `0` to `seen`, then when encountering the second `0`, it would check if `-0` (which is `0`) is in `seen`, find it, and return `True`. While this accidentally works for `[0, 0]`, the logic is correct by coincidence.\n\n   Actually, on further reflection, this case works correctly. When we see the second `0`, we check if `-0` (i.e., `0`) is in `seen`, which it is, so we return `True`. This is the correct behavior.\n\n2. **The implementation is actually correct**: Let me trace through the test cases:\n   - `[1, 3, 5, 0]`: No element has its negation appearing before it \u2192 False \u2713\n   - `[1, 3, -2, 1]`: No element has its negation appearing before it \u2192 False \u2713\n   - `[1, 2, 3, 7]`: No element has its negation appearing before it \u2192 False \u2713\n   - `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]`: When we reach `5`, `-5` is already in `seen` \u2192 True \u2713\n   - `[1]`: Only one element, loop runs once, no match \u2192 False \u2713\n\nThe algorithm correctly ensures distinct elements because it only checks if the negation exists in `seen` (elements already processed) before adding the current element. This guarantees we're comparing different positions in the list.\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND",
