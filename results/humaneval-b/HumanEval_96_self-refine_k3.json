It should say \"returns an array of all prime numbers less than n\" based on the examples provided. The current implementation correctly follows the examples (finding all primes less than n), not the literal docstring description (finding the first n primes).\n\n2. **No actual bugs in implementation**: Despite the confusing docstring, the implementation correctly matches all the provided examples:\n   - It returns all prime numbers less than n (not the first n primes)\n   - Handles edge cases correctly (n=0, n=1, n=2)\n   - Uses proper primality testing with optimization (checking up to sqrt(num))\n\n**Conclusion**: The code implementation is correct according to the examples, but the docstring wording is misleading. If we strictly interpret \"the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n\" literally, it's nonsensical (you can't have n primes all less than n for small values). The examples clarify the actual intent: find all primes less than n.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND** in the implementation itself - it correctly implements what the examples demonstrate.",
