The current implementation uses `if space_count > 2`, which correctly handles 3+ spaces. However, when there are exactly 2 consecutive spaces, they should be replaced with underscores (2 underscores), but the specification is ambiguous about whether 2 spaces should be treated as \"more than 2\" or not. Based on the examples provided, 2 spaces should be replaced with 2 underscores, which the current code does correctly.\n\nActually, upon closer review, let me reconsider: The specification says \"more than 2\" which means 3 or more. The code correctly implements this with `space_count > 2`. For 1 or 2 spaces, it replaces each with an underscore, which matches the examples.\n\n2. **Actually, NO ISSUES FOUND**: \n\nLet me trace through the examples:\n- `\"Example\"`: No spaces \u2192 returns \"Example\" \u2713\n- `\"Example 1\"`: 1 space \u2192 replaced with 1 underscore \u2192 \"Example_1\" \u2713\n- `\" Example 2\"`: 1 space at start, 1 space in middle \u2192 both replaced with underscores \u2192 \"_Example_2\" \u2713\n- `\" Example   3\"`: 1 space at start (\u2192 \"_\"), then \"Example\", then 3 consecutive spaces (\u2192 \"-\"), then \"3\" \u2192 \"_Example-3\" \u2713\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Counts consecutive spaces\n- Replaces groups of more than 2 spaces with a single \"-\"\n- Replaces groups of 1 or 2 spaces with the corresponding number of underscores\n- Handles non-space characters properly\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.",
