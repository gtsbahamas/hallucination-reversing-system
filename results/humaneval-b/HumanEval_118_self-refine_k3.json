      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect range in the loop**: The loop uses `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)`, which starts at index `len(word) - 2` and goes down to index `1` (stopping before `0`). This means it checks positions from the second-to-last character down to the second character. However, this misses checking the character at index `len(word) - 2` properly in the context of \"between two consonants.\"\n\n   **Specific issue**: For a word like \"yogurt\" (length 6), the loop starts at index 4 (character 'r'), but we want to check if index 4 ('r') could be a vowel between consonants. The real problem is more subtle - let me trace through:\n   - Index 4: 'r' (not a vowel)\n   - Index 3: 'u' (vowel), checks if word[2]='g' (consonant) and word[4]='r' (consonant) \u2713\n   \n   Actually, upon closer inspection, the range `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` iterates through indices that allow checking `word[i-1]` and `word[i+1]` without going out of bounds. For \"yogurt\":\n   - Starts at i=4, checks indices 3, 4, 5\n   - Then i=3, checks indices 2, 3, 4\n   - Then i=2, checks indices 1, 2, 3\n   - Then i=1, checks indices 0, 1, 2\n   \n   This is actually correct - it excludes the first (index 0) and last (index len(word)-1) characters as vowel candidates, which matches the spec.\n\n2. **Actually, re-examining the code**: The implementation appears to be correct. Let me verify with the examples:\n   - \"yogurt\": Checks from right, finds 'u' at index 3, between 'g' (consonant) and 'r' (consonant) \u2713\n   - \"FULL\": Checks 'L' (consonant), then 'U' at index 1, between 'F' (consonant) and 'L' (consonant) \u2713\n   - \"quick\": 'c' (consonant), 'i' is between 'u' (vowel) and 'c' (consonant) - fails condition, 'u' is between 'q' (consonant) and 'i' (vowel) - fails condition \u2713\n   - \"ab\": Length 2, returns \"\" \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND.\n\nThe implementation correctly handles all the requirements and test cases.",
