The code then appends 1 to the list, which is correct. However, this is actually handled correctly, so this is not an issue.\n\n2. **Incorrect handling when n=1**: Actually, upon closer inspection, when n=1, the loop doesn't execute, and then 1 is appended once, giving [1]. This matches the specification \"Collatz(1) is [1]\", so this is correct.\n\nLet me trace through the example:\n- n=5: current=5\n  - 5 is odd \u2192 append 5, current = 3*5+1 = 16\n  - 16 is even \u2192 current = 16//2 = 8\n  - 8 is even \u2192 current = 8//2 = 4\n  - 4 is even \u2192 current = 4//2 = 2\n  - 2 is even \u2192 current = 2//2 = 1\n  - Loop exits, append 1\n  - Result: [5, 1] \u2192 sorted: [1, 5] \u2713\n\nLet me check edge case n=1:\n- n=1: current=1\n  - Loop doesn't execute (current == 1)\n  - Append 1\n  - Result: [1] \u2713\n\nLet me check another case, n=3:\n- n=3: current=3\n  - 3 is odd \u2192 append 3, current = 3*3+1 = 10\n  - 10 is even \u2192 current = 10//2 = 5\n  - 5 is odd \u2192 append 5, current = 3*5+1 = 16\n  - 16 is even \u2192 current = 16//2 = 8\n  - 8 is even \u2192 current = 8//2 = 4\n  - 4 is even \u2192 current = 4//2 = 2\n  - 2 is even \u2192 current = 2//2 = 1\n  - Loop exits, append 1\n  - Result: [3, 5, 1] \u2192 sorted: [1, 3, 5] \u2713\n\nNO ISSUES FOUND\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n- Generates the Collatz sequence\n- Collects only odd numbers\n- Handles the special case where n=1\n- Returns a sorted list in increasing order\n- Includes 1 as the final odd number in the sequence",
