However, `encode_cyclic` performs a left rotation by 1 position (moving first char to end). To reverse this, you need to perform a right rotation by 1 position, which is equivalent to performing 2 more left rotations on a 3-character string.\n\n   **Why this is wrong**: \n   - Encode: \"abc\" \u2192 \"bca\" (left rotate by 1)\n   - Current decode: \"bca\" \u2192 \"abc\" (move last to front)\n   \n   While this appears to work, it's actually correct by coincidence! Moving the last character to the front IS the correct inverse operation for moving the first character to the end.\n\n   Actually, upon further analysis, **NO ISSUE HERE** - the logic is correct. Moving the last character to the beginning correctly reverses the encoding operation.\n\n2. **Actually, let me verify with an example**:\n   - Original: \"abc\"\n   - Encoded: \"bca\" (first char 'a' moved to end)\n   - Decoded with `group[-1] + group[:-1]`: 'a' + \"bc\" = \"abc\" \u2713\n   \n   This is correct!\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly reverses the encoding operation. The decode function properly:\n- Splits the string into groups of 3 characters (same as encoding)\n- For 3-character groups, moves the last character to the front (inverse of moving first to end)\n- Leaves groups with fewer than 3 characters unchanged (same as encoding)\n- Joins the groups back together",
