The function returns `-int(\"1\") + sum([])` = `-1 + 0` = `-1`, which is correct. However, this is fragile.\n\n2. **Incorrect handling of negative numbers in general**: For `n = -11`, `s = \"-11\"`, the function computes `-int(s[1]) + sum(int(d) for d in s[2:])` = `-int(\"1\") + sum([int(\"1\")])` = `-1 + 1` = `0`. This is correct based on the example.\n\n   But for `n = -12`, `s = \"-12\"`, it computes `-int(\"1\") + sum([int(\"2\")])` = `-1 + 2` = `1`. This is also correct.\n\n   Actually, upon closer inspection, the logic appears correct for the given examples.\n\n3. **Edge case not handled**: The function doesn't explicitly handle the case where `nums` is empty, but `sorted([])` returns `[]`, so this actually works correctly.\n\n4. **Potential issue with zero**: When `n = 0`, the function returns `0` early, which is correct.\n\nLet me verify the logic once more with the example:\n- `order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])`\n- `1`: digit_sum = 1\n- `11`: digit_sum = 1+1 = 2  \n- `-1`: digit_sum = -1\n- `-11`: digit_sum = -1+1 = 0\n- `-12`: digit_sum = -1+2 = 1\n\nSorted by digit_sum (stable): `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]` \u2713\n\nActually, **NO ISSUES FOUND**. The implementation correctly handles:\n- Positive numbers by summing all digits\n- Negative numbers by making only the first digit negative\n- Empty lists\n- Zero\n- Stable sorting (Python's `sorted()` is stable by default)",
