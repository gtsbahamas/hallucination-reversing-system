      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Empty string handling**: The function doesn't handle the edge case where `paren_string` is an empty string. When `''.split()` is called, it returns an empty list `[]`, which is correct behavior. However, this should be explicitly considered as valid input.\n\n2. **Whitespace-only string handling**: If `paren_string` contains only whitespace (e.g., `'   '`), `split()` will return an empty list, which may or may not be the intended behavior depending on specification.\n\n3. **Invalid characters not validated**: The function doesn't validate that groups contain only parentheses. If a group contains other characters (e.g., `'(a)'`), those characters are silently ignored. Depending on requirements, this might need validation or error handling.\n\n4. **Unbalanced parentheses not detected**: If a group has unbalanced parentheses (e.g., `'(()'` or `'())'`), the function will still return a result without indicating an error. For `'())'`, the `current_depth` would go negative, but `max_depth` would still be calculated. This might be acceptable depending on the specification, but it's worth noting.\n\n5. **Multiple consecutive spaces**: The `split()` method without arguments handles multiple consecutive spaces correctly (treats them as a single delimiter), so this is actually handled properly.\n\n**Verdict**: The implementation is functionally correct for well-formed input matching the docstring examples. However, it lacks input validation and error handling for malformed input. If the specification guarantees well-formed input (groups of balanced parentheses separated by spaces), then:\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND** (assuming well-formed input as implied by the docstring examples).\n\nIf stricter validation is required, the function should be enhanced to check for invalid characters and unbalanced parentheses.",
