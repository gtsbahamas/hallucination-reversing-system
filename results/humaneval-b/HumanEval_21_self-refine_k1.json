      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Division by zero when all numbers are equal**: If all elements in the list are the same (e.g., `[5.0, 5.0, 5.0]`), then `range_val = max_val - min_val = 0`, causing a division by zero error. While the docstring states \"at least two elements\", it doesn't guarantee they are different values. The function should handle this edge case, either by returning a list of zeros, raising a meaningful error, or checking if the range is zero.\n\n2. **Empty list not handled**: Although the docstring specifies \"at least two elements\", the function doesn't validate this. Calling `min()` and `max()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`. While this might be considered acceptable given the precondition, defensive programming would suggest adding validation or at minimum documenting this assumption clearly.\n\n**Recommended fixes:**\n\n```python\ndef rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    min_val = min(numbers)\n    max_val = max(numbers)\n    range_val = max_val - min_val\n    \n    # Handle case where all numbers are the same\n    if range_val == 0:\n        return [0.0] * len(numbers)  # or raise ValueError(\"All numbers are identical\")\n    \n    return [(x - min_val) / range_val for x in numbers]\n```\n\nThe most critical issue is #1 (division by zero), which will cause a runtime error for valid input that meets the \"at least two elements\" requirement.",
      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Primary Issue: Division by zero when all numbers are equal**\n\n**Lines to change:**\n- Add a check after line 3 (after `range_val = max_val - min_val`)\n\n**The fix:**\n```python\nif range_val == 0:\n    return [0.0] * len(numbers)\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- When all numbers are identical, `max_val == min_val`, making `range_val = 0`\n- Division by zero would crash the function\n- Returning a list of zeros is mathematically consistent: when all values are the same, they're already at the \"minimum\" of the range, so mapping them to 0 is appropriate\n- This satisfies the spec's requirement of \"at least two elements\" without requiring they be different values\n\n**Secondary consideration (optional but recommended):**\n- Add input validation at the start to check `len(numbers) >= 2`\n- However, since the spec explicitly states \"at least two elements\" as a precondition, this is less critical than the division-by-zero fix\n\n**Priority:** Fix the division-by-zero issue first (lines 4-5). Input validation is optional defensive programming.",
