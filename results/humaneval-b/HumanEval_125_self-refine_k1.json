      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect odd order calculation**: The function counts letters where `order % 2 == 1`, which means it's counting letters at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. (b, d, f, h, ...). However, according to the specification where `ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25`, \"odd order\" should mean odd position values. Let me verify with the example:\n   - In \"abcdef\": a=0(even), b=1(odd), c=2(even), d=3(odd), e=4(even), f=5(odd)\n   - The example states the answer should be 3, which matches b, d, f (positions 1, 3, 5)\n   \n   Actually, upon closer inspection, the current implementation IS correct for this. The code checks `order % 2 == 1` which correctly identifies odd positions (1, 3, 5, ...).\n\n2. **Edge case with whitespace after comma split**: If the text contains commas but the split results in elements with leading/trailing whitespace, those won't be trimmed. For example, `\"Hello, world!\"` would return `[\"Hello\", \" world!\"]` with a leading space. While the specification doesn't explicitly require trimming, the example `split_words(\"Hello,world!\")` suggests no spaces should be present. However, since the example doesn't have spaces around the comma, this may be acceptable behavior.\n\n3. **Empty string edge case**: If an empty string is passed, the function will return `0`, which is technically correct (no lowercase letters with odd order), but this edge case should be considered.\n\n4. **Mixed whitespace and comma case**: If text contains both whitespace AND commas (e.g., \"Hello, world test\"), the function will split on whitespace only, ignoring commas. This follows the specification's priority order, so it's correct.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the implementation appears to be **correct** according to the specification. The logic properly handles the three cases in priority order, and the odd order calculation matches the expected output in the example.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**",
