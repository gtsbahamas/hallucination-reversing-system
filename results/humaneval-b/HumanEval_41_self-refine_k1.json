Here's why:\n\n**Logic Analysis:**\n- Each of the n cars moving left-to-right will eventually collide with each of the n cars moving right-to-left exactly once\n- Since cars pass through each other without stopping or changing direction, all possible pairings will result in collisions\n- Total collisions = n \u00d7 n = n\u00b2\n\n**Edge Cases Handled:**\n- n = 0: Returns 0 (correct - no cars means no collisions)\n- n = 1: Returns 1 (correct - one car from each direction collides once)\n- n > 1: Returns n\u00b2 (correct - all pairwise collisions occur)\n\n**Assumptions Met:**\n- The problem states cars start \"very far from each other,\" ensuring all cars will eventually meet\n- All cars move at the same speed, so relative positions within each group don't matter\n- Cars are on the same road (same line), so all left-to-right cars will intersect with all right-to-left cars\n\nThe solution correctly implements the combinatorial principle that each car from one set collides with every car from the other set exactly once.",
