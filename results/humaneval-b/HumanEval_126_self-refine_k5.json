      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect interpretation of \"more than 1 duplicate\"**: The specification states \"If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, return False.\" This means if a number appears MORE THAN TWICE (i.e., 3 or more times), return False. However, the phrase \"more than 1 duplicate\" is ambiguous. Looking at the examples:\n   - `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` returns `True` - each duplicate appears exactly twice (1 duplicate of each)\n   - `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` returns `False` - the number 2 appears 3 times (2 duplicates, which is \"more than 1 duplicate\")\n\n   The current implementation checks `if count > 2`, which is correct for the examples provided. So this is actually **correct**.\n\n2. **Edge case with empty list**: The function handles `len(lst) <= 1` correctly, returning `True` for both empty lists and single-element lists, which aligns with the specification.\n\nUpon careful review of the implementation against all provided examples:\n- `[5]` \u2192 True \u2713\n- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` \u2192 True \u2713\n- `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` \u2192 False \u2713\n- `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` \u2192 True \u2713 (each number appears at most twice)\n- `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` \u2192 False \u2713 (2 appears 3 times)\n\nThe logic correctly:\n1. Checks if the list is sorted in ascending order\n2. Checks if any number appears more than twice (which means \"more than 1 duplicate\")\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly matches the specification and handles all the provided test cases.",
