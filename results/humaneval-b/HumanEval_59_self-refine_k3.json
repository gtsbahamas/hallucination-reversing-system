      "verification": "ISSUES FOUND:\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of the assumption \"n is not a prime\"**: The docstring states \"Assume n > 1 and is not a prime,\" but the code includes logic to handle the case where n itself is prime (the `if n > 1: largest = n` block at the end). While this makes the function more robust, it contradicts the stated assumption. However, this is actually a good thing and makes the code work correctly even if the assumption is violated.\n\n2. **Incorrect result for the first test case**: Let me trace through `largest_prime_factor(13195)`:\n   - 13195 is odd, so the while loop for factor 2 doesn't execute\n   - Check i=3: 13195 / 3 = 4398.33... (not divisible)\n   - Check i=5: 13195 / 5 = 2639, so largest=5, n=2639\n   - Continue with n=2639, i=5: 2639 / 5 = 527.8 (not divisible)\n   - Check i=7: 2639 / 7 = 377, so largest=7, n=377\n   - Continue with n=377, i=7: 377 / 7 = 53.86... (not divisible)\n   - Check i=9, 11, 13: none divide 377\n   - When i=19: 19*19 = 361 <= 377, check if 377 / 19 = 19.84... (not divisible)\n   - When i=21: 21*21 = 441 > 377, exit loop\n   - n=377 > 1, so largest = 377\n   \n   But 377 = 13 \u00d7 29, so 377 is not prime! The algorithm fails because it doesn't check all potential factors up to sqrt(377). Specifically, it skips i=13 (checking 3,5,7,9,11,13...), but let me recalculate: after i=7, n=377, and i increments by 2 each time: 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19...\n   \n   Actually, 377 / 13 = 29, so when i=13, it should divide. Let me verify: the loop should check i=13. The condition is `i * i <= n`, so `13 * 13 = 169 <= 377` is true. So i=13 should be checked, and the code should work correctly for this case.\n\nActually, upon careful review, the algorithm is correct. Let me verify the first test case properly:\n- 13195 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 29\n- The algorithm will find all these factors and return 29 as the largest.\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation is correct. The algorithm efficiently finds the largest prime factor by trial division, and the final check handles the case where the remaining n is itself a prime factor larger than all previously found factors.",
