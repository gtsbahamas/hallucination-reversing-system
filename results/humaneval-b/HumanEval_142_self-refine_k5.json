Indices that are multiples of both 3 and 4 (like 0, 12, 24...) \u2192 squares them (multiple of 3 takes precedence)\n2. Indices that are multiples of 3 only \u2192 squares them\n3. Indices that are multiples of 4 only \u2192 cubes them\n4. All other indices \u2192 keeps them unchanged\n\nThe logic properly implements the specification's requirement that cubing only happens when the index is a multiple of 4 \"and not a multiple of 3.\"\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**\n\nThe implementation correctly matches the specification and handles all test cases properly.",
