If any even digit is found, it returns `False`.\n\n2. **Filters the list**: Uses list comprehension to keep only numbers that have no even digits.\n\n3. **Returns sorted result**: Sorts the filtered list in increasing order as required.\n\n4. **Handles the examples correctly**:\n   - `[15, 33, 1422, 1]` \u2192 `[1, 15, 33]` \u2713 (1422 has even digits 4 and 2, 152 would have 2)\n   - `[152, 323, 1422, 10]` \u2192 `[]` \u2713 (all numbers contain at least one even digit: 152 has 2, 323 has 2, 1422 has 4 and 2, 10 has 0)\n\n5. **Handles edge cases**: Empty lists would return empty lists, single-element lists work correctly, and the function properly handles all positive integers as specified.",
