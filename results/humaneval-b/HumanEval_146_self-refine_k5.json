For example, `str(-73)` gives `'-73'`, so `num_str[0]` is `'-'`, which will cause a `ValueError` when trying to convert it to an integer with `int(num_str[0])`.\n\n   **Fix**: Since the condition `num > 10` already filters out negative numbers, this won't cause a runtime error in practice. However, the logic should be more explicit. Alternatively, use `abs(num)` when converting to string, or access `num_str[0]` only after ensuring it's a digit.\n\n2. **The code actually works correctly for the given specification**: Upon closer inspection, since the condition `num > 10` is checked first, all negative numbers (including -73 and -15 from the examples) are already filtered out before string conversion. Therefore, the bug described in issue #1 won't actually occur during execution.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n\n**Actually, NO ISSUES FOUND**.\n\nThe implementation is correct because:\n- The condition `num > 10` ensures only positive numbers greater than 10 are processed\n- This eliminates all negative numbers before string conversion\n- For positive numbers > 10, `str(num)` will only contain digits\n- The first and last digit extraction works correctly\n- The odd check (`% 2 == 1`) is correct for positive integers\n\nTesting with examples:\n- `specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15])`: Only 15 qualifies (>10, first=1 odd, last=5 odd) => 1 \u2713\n- `specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109])`: 33 (3,3) and 21 (2,1) are >10, but 21 has even first digit. Only 33 and 109 qualify => 2 \u2713\n\n**NO ISSUES FOUND**",
