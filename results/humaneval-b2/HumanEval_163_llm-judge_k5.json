The examples confirm:\n- `generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]` - even digits in range\n- `generate_integers(10, 14) => []` - no digits (all are 2-digit numbers)\n\nThe current implementation correctly interprets \"digits\" as single-digit numbers (0-9).\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix needed** - the implementation is correct as-is.\n\nThe code properly:\n1. Normalizes the range using `min(a, b)` and `max(a, b)`\n2. Restricts results to single digits with `num <= 9`\n3. Filters for even numbers with `num % 2 == 0`\n4. Returns results in ascending order (natural order from `range()`)\n\nIf there was feedback suggesting this is wrong, it may be based on a misunderstanding of the specification. The term \"digits\" specifically means 0-9, not arbitrary integers in the range.",
