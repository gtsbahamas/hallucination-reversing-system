      "remediation": "Looking at the judge assessment, **all test cases pass**. The implementation is actually correct!\n\nHowever, let me verify the specification one more time:\n\nThe docstring says: *\"returns an array of the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n\"*\n\nThis is slightly ambiguous, but based on the examples:\n- `count_up_to(5) => [2,3]` - returns primes less than 5\n- `count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]` - returns primes less than 11\n\nThe function should return **all prime numbers less than n** (not \"the first n primes\").\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation already does this correctly:\n- Line 11: `if n <= 2: return []` handles edge cases (0, 1, 2)\n- Line 14: `for num in range(2, n)` iterates through all numbers less than n\n- Lines 15-19: Correctly implements primality testing using trial division\n- Line 20-21: Adds prime numbers to the result list\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No fix is needed.** The implementation is correct and passes all test cases. The function properly:\n1. Returns all prime numbers less than n\n2. Handles all edge cases (n=0, n=1, n=2)\n3. Uses an efficient primality test (trial division up to \u221an)\n\nIf there were an actual issue reported that contradicts the judge assessment, please provide that feedback so I can address it.",
