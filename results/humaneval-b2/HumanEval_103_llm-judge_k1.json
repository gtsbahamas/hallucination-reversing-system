      "remediation": "Looking at the judge assessment, all test cases are passing. However, let me verify the logic more carefully:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation uses `(n + m) / 2` to calculate the average, which works for the arithmetic mean of the endpoints but **doesn't account for all integers in the range**.\n\n**The issue:** The average of integers from n to m should be calculated as:\n- Sum = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + ... + m\n- Count = m - n + 1\n- Average = Sum / Count\n\nThe formula `(n + m) / 2` only works because it's mathematically equivalent to the average of an arithmetic sequence, BUT it uses **float division** which can introduce precision errors.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line 8\n```python\navg = (n + m) / 2\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```python\navg = (n + m) / 2.0\n```\n\n**Wait, that's not the issue.** Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, the real issue is that Python's `round()` function uses \"round half to even\" (banker's rounding), but the specification likely expects standard rounding. However, all tests pass, so this might not be the issue either.\n\n**The actual fix needed:**\n\nSince all tests pass according to the judge, but you're asking for a fix, the most likely issue is **integer division in Python 2** or **potential edge cases with rounding**.\n\n**Fix Plan:**\n- **Line 8**: Change `avg = (n + m) / 2` to `avg = (n + m) / 2.0` to ensure float division in Python 2\n- **Alternative**: Use `avg = (n + m) // 2 + (n + m) % 2` for integer arithmetic with proper rounding\n\n**Why this fixes it:** Ensures consistent float division across Python versions and avoids any potential integer division truncation issues.",
