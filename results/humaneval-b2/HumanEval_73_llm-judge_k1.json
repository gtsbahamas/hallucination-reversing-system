      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **no fix is needed**. \n\nThe implementation is correct:\n\n- All test cases pass\n- The algorithm correctly identifies mismatched pairs by comparing elements from both ends\n- It properly handles both odd and even length arrays\n- Edge cases (empty, single element) work correctly\n\nThe function already implements the optimal solution: comparing `arr[i]` with `arr[n-1-i]` for the first half of the array and counting mismatches. Each mismatch requires exactly one change to make the pair equal, giving the minimum number of changes needed for palindromicity.\n\n**Verdict: No changes required.**",
