      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **no fix is needed**. \n\n## Analysis\n\nAll test cases pass:\n- \u2705 Correctly returns total eaten carrots\n- \u2705 Correctly returns remaining carrots\n- \u2705 Handles case when enough carrots available (eats exactly `need`)\n- \u2705 Handles case when not enough carrots (eats all `remaining`)\n- \u2705 All 4 examples produce expected output\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe current implementation is **correct and complete**. The logic properly:\n1. Uses `min(need, remaining)` to determine actual carrots eaten\n2. Adds to previously eaten count for total\n3. Subtracts from stock for remaining count\n\nNo changes required.",
