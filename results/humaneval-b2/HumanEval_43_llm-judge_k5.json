Handles the edge case of `[0, 0]` correctly (would return `True` since `-0 == 0`)\n\n## Potential Issue (if any exists)\n\nThe only edge case to consider is **duplicate zeros**: `[0, 0]`\n- When processing the first `0`: `-0` (which is `0`) is not in `seen`, so add `0` to `seen`\n- When processing the second `0`: `-0` (which is `0`) IS in `seen`, so return `True` \u2713\n\nThis is correct behavior since we have two distinct elements (at different positions) that sum to zero.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No fix needed.** The implementation is correct as-is.
