      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The implementation is actually **correct** based on the examples, but there's a terminology confusion in the specification.\n\n**Analysis**: \n- The spec says \"more than 1 duplicate\" which is ambiguous\n- The examples clarify: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` \u2192 True (each number appears **twice** = 1 duplicate)\n- `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` \u2192 False (number 2 appears **three times** = 2 duplicates)\n- The implementation correctly checks `count > 2`, which means \"more than 2 occurrences\" = \"more than 1 duplicate\"\n\n**No code changes needed** - the implementation is correct.\n\nHowever, if we want to make the code clearer and match the specification language better:\n\n**Optional Clarification** (Line 20):\n```python\n# Change comment from:\n# Check for more than 1 duplicate of the same number\n\n# To:\n# Check for more than 2 occurrences (more than 1 duplicate) of the same number\n```\n\n**Why this works**: \n- \"More than 1 duplicate\" = \"more than 2 total occurrences\"\n- 2 occurrences = original + 1 duplicate (allowed)\n- 3+ occurrences = original + 2+ duplicates (not allowed)\n- The condition `count > 2` correctly implements this logic\n\nThe implementation matches all test cases correctly; only the comment could be clearer about the interpretation.",
