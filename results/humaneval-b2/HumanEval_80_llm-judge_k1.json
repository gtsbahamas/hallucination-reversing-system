      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe judge assessment shows that **all test cases are passing**. The implementation correctly:\n1. Checks if the string length is at least 3\n2. Iterates through all 3-consecutive letter windows\n3. Verifies each window has 3 distinct characters\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix is needed.** The current implementation is correct and handles all the specified requirements and test cases properly.\n\nThe logic is sound:\n- Line 11-12: Correctly rejects strings shorter than 3 characters\n- Line 14-16: Correctly iterates through all sliding windows of size 3 and checks distinctness using `set()`\n- Line 18: Correctly returns True if all windows pass the distinctness check\n\nThe implementation matches the specification perfectly.",
