The judge's first assessment note mentions a semantic consideration about the inequality check, but then confirms it's actually correct:\n\n- The spec requires: \"sum of any two sides is **greater than** the third side\" (a + b > c)\n- The implementation checks: `if a + b <= c` (negation for invalidity)\n- This correctly returns -1 for degenerate triangles where a + b = c\n\n**Conclusion:** The function works correctly and requires no modifications.",
