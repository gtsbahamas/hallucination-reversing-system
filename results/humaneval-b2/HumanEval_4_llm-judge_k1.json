Calculates the mean: `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`\n2. Computes absolute deviations: `abs(x - mean) for x in numbers`\n3. Returns the average of those deviations: `sum(...) / len(numbers)`\n\nThe judge confirmed all claims pass, including the example test case where `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]` correctly returns `1.0`.\n\n## No Changes Required\n\nThe implementation matches the specification exactly. The only potential improvement would be adding empty list handling, but this isn't required by the specification.",
