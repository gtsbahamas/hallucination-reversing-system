      "remediation": "Looking at the judge assessment, all test cases pass. However, let me verify the logic against the specification more carefully.\n\nThe issue is with the **single character case** (line 21-22):\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** When `txt` has length 1 (a single alphabetical character), the function returns `True`. But according to the specification, a character is \"not part of a word\" only if it's separated by spaces. A single character with no spaces around it IS a word by itself, so it should return `False`.\n\n**Fix:**\n- **Line 21-22**: Change from `return True` to `return False`\n  \n**Reasoning:**\n- The specification states the character must \"not be a part of a word\"\n- A \"word\" is defined as \"a group of characters separated by space\"\n- A single alphabetical character like \"a\" is itself a word (not separated from anything)\n- For a character to not be part of a word, it must be isolated by spaces (e.g., \"word a\" or \"a \" where we check the 'a')\n- The current examples don't test single character input, but logically \"a\" should return `False` because 'a' is a complete word, not a standalone letter separated from words\n\n**Corrected logic:**\n```\nif len(txt) == 1:\n    return False\n```\n\nThis ensures that only alphabetical characters preceded by a space (and thus separated from the preceding word) return `True`.",
