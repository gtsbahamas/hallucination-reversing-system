      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **all test cases are passing**. The implementation correctly:\n- Splits sentences by '.', '?' or '!'\n- Strips whitespace from each sentence\n- Checks if sentences start with the word \"I\" (either \"I \" or just \"I\")\n- Returns the correct count\n\n**No fix is needed.** The current implementation is correct and handles all the specified requirements properly.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues in practice, they might be edge cases not covered by the specification. Potential edge cases to consider (though not required by the spec):\n- Multiple consecutive delimiters (e.g., \"Hello.. I am here\")\n- \"I\" as part of a longer word (e.g., \"Ice cream\") - currently correctly rejected\n- Empty string input - currently returns 0 (correct)\n\nBut based on the specification and judge assessment provided, the implementation is working as intended.",
