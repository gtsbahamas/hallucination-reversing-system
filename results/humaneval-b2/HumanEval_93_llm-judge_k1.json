      "remediation": "The implementation looks correct based on the judge's assessment - all claims pass. However, let me verify the logic once more against the specification:\n\n**Current implementation is actually CORRECT**, but if there were any edge cases to consider, here's what to watch for:\n\n## Potential Edge Case Issue (if it exists):\n\n**Line to check:** `new_char = chr(ord(swapped) + 2)`\n\n**Potential problem:** This could fail for vowels near the end of the alphabet (like 'Y' or 'y'), but since vowels are only 'aeiouAEIOU', the maximum is 'U' (ASCII 85) or 'u' (ASCII 117), which safely map to 'W' (87) and 'w' (119) respectively. So this is fine.\n\n## Verification:\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. \u2705 Swaps case first using `swapcase()`\n2. \u2705 Checks if the swapped character is a vowel\n3. \u2705 Replaces vowels with `chr(ord(swapped) + 2)` (2 places ahead)\n4. \u2705 Preserves non-alphabetic characters\n\n**Conclusion:** No fix needed. The implementation is correct as-is. All test cases pass and the logic matches the specification perfectly.\n\nIf you're seeing failures in practice, it might be due to:\n- Different test cases not shown here\n- Environment-specific issues\n- The judge assessment might have false positives\n\nBut based on the provided specification and examples, **this implementation is correct and requires no changes**.",
