      "remediation": "The implementation is **already correct** and passes all test cases. However, I can identify a potential improvement for code clarity and a minor edge case consideration:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation correctly:\n1. Counts water units per well using `sum(row)`\n2. Calculates bucket lowerings using `math.ceil(water_units / capacity)`\n3. Accumulates and returns the total\n\nAll judge assessments show PASS verdicts, and the logic handles all examples and edge cases properly.\n\n## Potential Optimization (Optional)\n\nIf there were any issue to address, it would be the division by zero risk, but given the constraints state `1 <= capacity <= 10`, this is guaranteed not to occur.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No fix is needed.** The implementation is correct as-is. \n\nIf you're seeing failures in practice, the issue likely lies outside this function (e.g., how it's being called, input validation, or test harness problems), not in the logic itself.\n\nThe only cosmetic improvement would be to move the import to the top of the file rather than inside the function, but this doesn't affect correctness:\n\n```python\n# Move this to module level (outside function)\nimport math\n```\n\nBut again, this is style, not a bug fix.",
