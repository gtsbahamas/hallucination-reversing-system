All claims pass:\n\n1. \u2705 Returns the decimal part correctly\n2. \u2705 Properly decomposes into integer and decimal parts\n3. \u2705 Handles the example case correctly\n\nThe implementation `return number - int(number)` is correct for the specification, which explicitly states \"positive floating point number\". The `int()` function truncates toward zero, which for positive numbers gives the floor (largest integer smaller than the number), making the solution valid.\n\n**Fix Plan: None required** - the implementation is correct as-is.\n\n---\n\n*Note: If the specification were to be extended to handle negative numbers, then a fix would be needed (using `math.floor()` instead of `int()`), but that's not part of the current specification.*",
