      "remediation": "Based on the judge assessment, **no fix is needed**. \n\nAll test cases pass:\n- \u2705 Single unclosed bracket returns False\n- \u2705 Matched pair returns True  \n- \u2705 Nested brackets return True\n- \u2705 Closing before opening returns False\n- \u2705 Balance tracking works correctly\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. Tracks bracket balance with a counter\n2. Increments for `<`, decrements for `>`\n3. Immediately rejects when count goes negative (closing bracket without matching opening)\n4. Returns True only when final count is 0 (all brackets matched)\n\n**Conclusion: The current implementation is correct and requires no changes.**",
