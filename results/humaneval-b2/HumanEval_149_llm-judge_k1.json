      "remediation": "Looking at the judge assessment, **all claims pass** - the implementation is actually correct!\n\nHowever, I notice there's a **discrepancy in the specification itself**:\n\n## Issue in Specification (Not Implementation)\n\nThe specification states:\n> \"You may assume that all words will have the same length.\"\n\nBut the examples clearly show words with **different lengths**:\n- `[\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]` - lengths 2, 1, 3\n- `[\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]` - lengths 2, 1, 3, 2\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No fix needed for the implementation** - it correctly:\n1. Filters out odd-length strings\n2. Sorts by length (ascending)\n3. Sorts alphabetically for same-length strings\n4. Returns the correct results for both examples\n\nThe only issue is the contradictory statement in the docstring that should be removed or clarified. If you want to fix the docstring:\n\n**Line to change:** Remove or modify the line:\n```python\n\"You may assume that all words will have the same length.\"\n```\n\nThis statement is misleading since the function explicitly handles words of different lengths, and the examples demonstrate this capability.",
