      "remediation": "Looking at the judge assessment, all test cases are passing. However, let me analyze the implementation for potential edge cases or robustness issues:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation has a subtle bug with the `isdigit()` method:\n\n**Problem**: `isdigit()` only returns `True` for strings containing only digit characters. It will fail for:\n- Negative numbers (e.g., \"-5\")\n- Numbers with leading/trailing whitespace\n- Multi-word numbers that might be split differently\n\nHowever, based on the specification examples, all inputs appear to use non-negative integers, so this might not be an issue in practice.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix needed** - The implementation is correct for the given specification.\n\nAll test cases pass because:\n1. The function correctly extracts numeric values from the string\n2. It properly calculates mangoes as `total - apples - oranges`\n3. All provided examples work correctly\n\n**Potential Enhancement** (optional, not required by spec):\nIf you want to make it more robust for edge cases not in the specification:\n- Line 5: Replace `if part.isdigit():` with `if part.lstrip('-').isdigit():` to handle negative numbers\n- Or use try-except: `try: numbers.append(int(part))` to handle any numeric format\n\nBut based on the specification and passing tests, **the current implementation is correct and requires no changes**.",
