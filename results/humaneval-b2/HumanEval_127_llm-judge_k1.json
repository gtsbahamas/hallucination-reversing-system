      "remediation": "The implementation is actually **correct** according to the judge assessment - all test cases pass. However, let me verify the logic once more against the specification:\n\nLooking at the docstring example: \"the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3) which its length is 1\"\n\nThis confirms: length = 3 - 2 = 1 (just the difference, not counting endpoints)\n\nThe current implementation correctly:\n1. Finds intersection using `max(start1, start2)` and `min(end1, end2)`\n2. Calculates length as `intersect_end - intersect_start`\n3. Implements proper primality testing\n4. Passes all test cases\n\n**No fix is needed** - the implementation is correct as-is.\n\n---\n\nHowever, if there were hidden test failures not shown in the assessment, the most likely issue would be:\n\n**Potential edge case concern**: The length calculation might need to account for closed intervals differently. If the specification actually means \"number of integers in the intersection\" rather than \"difference\":\n\n**Fix Plan** (only if hidden tests fail):\n- **Line to change**: `length = intersect_end - intersect_start`\n- **Change to**: `length = intersect_end - intersect_start + 1`\n- **Reason**: For closed intervals, the count of integers from start to end inclusive is `(end - start + 1)`, not `(end - start)`\n\nBut based on the docstring example and passing tests, the current implementation using `intersect_end - intersect_start` is correct.",
