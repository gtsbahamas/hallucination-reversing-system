      "remediation": "The implementation is **correct** and passes all test cases. No fix is needed.\n\n**Why it works:**\n1. The algorithm iterates through the list once, checking if the negative of each number exists in the `seen` set before adding the current number\n2. This ensures we only find pairs at distinct positions (we check before adding)\n3. It correctly handles all edge cases including single elements, zeros, and lists with/without valid pairs\n\nThe judge assessment confirms all claims pass. The implementation is optimal with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.",
