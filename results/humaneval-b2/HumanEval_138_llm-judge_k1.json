      "remediation": "The implementation is **already correct** and passes all test cases. No fix is needed.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe function correctly implements the logic:\n1. Checks if `n >= 8` (minimum sum of four positive even numbers: 2+2+2+2)\n2. Checks if `n % 2 == 0` (sum of even numbers must be even)\n\nBoth conditions are necessary and sufficient:\n- Any even number \u2265 8 can be decomposed as: 2+2+2+(n-6), where n-6 is positive and even\n- Any number < 8 or odd cannot satisfy the requirement\n\n**Verdict:** No changes required. The implementation is optimal and correct.",
