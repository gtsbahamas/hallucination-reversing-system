However, the logic is actually fine for the given specification. The most likely issue is that the function doesn't handle edge cases like:\n1. Lists containing zeros (product should be 0)\n2. Lists with negative numbers\n3. Single element lists\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at the code more carefully, the implementation is actually correct for the specification. However, if tests are failing on \"edge case handling,\" the issue might be:\n\n**Most Likely Problem:**\nThe explicit empty list check at lines 10-11 is redundant and might be causing issues if the test framework expects consistent behavior. The `sum()` function already returns 0 for empty lists, and the product loop would leave `total_product` as 1.\n\n**Fix Plan:**\n\n**Option 1 (If the empty check is the issue):**\n- Remove lines 10-11 (the explicit empty list check)\n- The function will naturally handle empty lists: `sum([])` returns 0, and the loop won't execute, leaving `total_product` as 1\n\n**Option 2 (If there's a subtle logic issue):**\n- Keep the structure but ensure consistency\n- Lines 10-11: Keep as is\n- Lines 13-17: The logic is correct\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\nRemove the explicit empty list check (lines 10-11) since it's redundant:\n- `sum([])` already returns 0\n- The for loop naturally handles empty lists (doesn't execute, leaving product as 1)\n\nThis makes the code simpler and eliminates a potential branch that might be tested differently.",

However, looking at the test failure about \"return type\", the actual issue is likely that the function works correctly but there may be an edge case or the tuple elements are in the wrong order.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The test says \"return type is incorrect\" - looking at the code again:\n\n**Actual Issue**: The function is correct in logic and order. The problem must be with how it handles the empty list case or there's a subtle issue. Let me trace through:\n- Empty list: `sum([]) = 0`, product loop doesn't execute so `total_product = 1` \u2713\n- `[1,2,3,4]`: `sum = 10`, `product = 24` \u2713\n\nThe issue is likely that the return statement has the values in the **wrong order** based on how the test is checking. But reviewing the spec again, it clearly states \"sum and a product\" in that order, which matches the implementation.\n\n**Most likely issue**: The return type annotation or the actual return might need adjustment. However, given the test failure message, the implementation looks correct.\n\n**Alternative diagnosis**: Perhaps the test is checking that we return exactly `Tuple[int, int]` but we might be returning something else in edge cases.\n\n**Fix Plan**:\n\nNo changes needed - the implementation is correct. However, if the test is still failing, verify:\n\n1. **Line 13**: Ensure the return statement maintains the order `(total_sum, total_product)` - which it does\n2. The function correctly handles empty lists (sum=0, product=1) - which it does\n3. The function correctly calculates both values for non-empty lists - which it does\n\n**If test still fails**, the issue is likely in the test itself, not the implementation. The code correctly implements the specification.",

When a zero is in the list, the product should be 0, but the current implementation would correctly compute this. However, there's a subtle issue: the implementation doesn't handle the empty list case explicitly, though it works correctly due to Python's `sum()` behavior.\n\nActually, reviewing more carefully: The implementation should work correctly for all cases including:\n- Empty list: `sum([])` = 0, product loop doesn't execute so product = 1 \u2713\n- List with zeros: product correctly becomes 0 \u2713\n- Normal lists: both sum and product computed correctly \u2713\n\n**Most Likely Issue:**\nThe test failure suggests an edge case problem. The most probable issue is with **negative numbers** or **large numbers causing overflow**, but given the simple test cases, the implementation actually appears correct.\n\n**However, if there IS a bug**, it would be:\n\n**No changes needed** - the implementation is correct as written. It properly:\n1. Uses `sum()` which returns 0 for empty lists\n2. Initializes product to 1 (correct for empty list)\n3.
