Uses nested loops to compare each pair of numbers exactly once (avoiding duplicate comparisons and self-comparisons)\n2. Calculates the absolute difference between each pair\n3. Returns `True` immediately when a pair is found with distance less than the threshold\n4. Returns `False` if no such pair exists after checking all combinations\n\nThe implementation satisfies both test cases:\n- `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` with threshold `0.5`: minimum distance is 1.0, which is not < 0.5, returns `False` \u2713\n- `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]` with threshold `0.3`: distance between 2.8 and 3.0 is 0.2, which is < 0.3, returns `True` \u2713",
