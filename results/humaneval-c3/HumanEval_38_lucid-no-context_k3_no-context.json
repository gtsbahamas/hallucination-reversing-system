      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation contains explanatory text that's not in a comment or docstring, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 18-31 (the entire explanation and implementation after the docstring)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove all the explanatory text (lines 18-28) and keep only the actual function implementation (lines 30-35). The function body should start immediately after the docstring.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python code (not in comments/strings) appears where only valid Python statements are expected. The explanation \"Looking at the `encode_cyclic` function...\" is plain text that Python tries to parse as code, causing the syntax error.\n\n**Corrected structure:**\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.\n    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n```\n\nThe logic itself is correct - it reverses the encoding by moving the last character to the beginning for groups of 3, which undoes the original operation of moving the first character to the end.",
