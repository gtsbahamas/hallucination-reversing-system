      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation code contains **comments formatted as markdown list items** (lines starting with `-`) which are not valid Python syntax.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 44-47 (the comment block inside the function)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove or properly format the markdown-style comments. These lines:\n```\n- Count the number of 1s (water units)\n- Divide by bucket capacity and round up to get the number of times to lower the bucket\n- Use `math.ceil()` for rounding up\n```\n\nShould either be:\n1. **Removed entirely** (the code is self-explanatory), OR\n2. **Converted to proper Python comments** using `#`:\n```python\n# Count the number of 1s (water units)\n# Divide by bucket capacity and round up to get the number of times to lower the bucket\n# Use math.ceil() for rounding up\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nPython doesn't recognize `-` as a comment marker. The parser tries to interpret `- Count` as a subtraction operation, leading to \"invalid decimal literal\" when it encounters the word \"Count\". Using `#` for comments or removing them entirely will make the code syntactically valid.\n\n**Recommended action:** Remove these comment lines entirely since the code logic is already clear and well-documented in the docstring above.",
