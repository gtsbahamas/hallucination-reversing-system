      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that there's explanatory text mixed into the Python code file, causing a syntax error. The actual implementation logic appears correct, but it needs to be properly formatted as a Python function without the prose explanation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove all the explanatory text that appears before and within the function definition.\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Remove the entire block of text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...So the pattern is clear. For n=0, it appears to be 1 (base case).\"\n2. Keep only the actual Python function definition starting with `def tri(n):` and its implementation\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe SyntaxError occurs because Python is trying to parse plain English text as Python code. The text \"Looking at this problem...\" is not valid Python syntax. By removing all non-code text and keeping only the function definition and implementation, the file will be valid Python that can be executed.\n\nThe actual logic in the implementation is correct:\n- Handles base case for n=0\n- Initializes result with [1, 3] for tri(0) and tri(1)\n- Correctly applies even formula: `1 + i // 2`\n- Correctly applies odd formula by pre-calculating tri(i+1) using the even formula\n- Returns the complete list\n\nThe only issue is the formatting/syntax error from including explanatory text in the code file.",
