      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code has a syntax error because the multi-line comment/reasoning text before the function definition is not properly formatted as a comment or docstring.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-14 (the reasoning text before the function definition)\n\n**What to do**: Remove or comment out the reasoning text that appears before the function definition. This text is causing a syntax error because it's not part of a string, comment, or valid Python syntax.\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Delete lines 1-14 (all the text starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" up to but not including the `def move_one_ball(arr):` line)\n- OR prefix each of those lines with `#` to make them comments\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe reasoning text contains unescaped quotes and is not valid Python syntax. Python is trying to parse it as code, which causes the \"unterminated string literal\" error when it encounters the numbered list item \"5. If there's one break point...\" The apostrophe in \"there's\" is being interpreted as a string delimiter.\n\nThe actual function logic appears correct - it properly:\n1. Handles empty arrays\n2. Handles single-element arrays  \n3. Counts break points where arr[i] > arr[i+1]\n4. Returns True for 0 break points (already sorted)\n5. Returns True for 1 break point if arr[-1] <= arr[0] (valid rotation)\n6. Returns False for 2+ break points\n\nThe only issue is the extraneous text before the function definition.",
