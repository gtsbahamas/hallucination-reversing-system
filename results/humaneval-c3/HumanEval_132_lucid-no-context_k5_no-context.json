      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue - the docstring or comments are malformed. But more importantly, let me analyze the logic issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem with current approach:**\nThe function checks for consecutive opening brackets in a forward pass and consecutive closing brackets in a backward pass. However, this doesn't guarantee these brackets can actually form a valid nested structure together. For example, in `[]]]]]]][[[[[]`, we have 2+ consecutive `[` and 2+ consecutive `]`, but they can't form a valid nested pair.\n\n**The fix:**\n\n1. **Remove the syntax error** - The implementation has stray text that's not properly commented/quoted\n\n2. **Fix the core logic** - Need to ensure the consecutive opening brackets come BEFORE the consecutive closing brackets in the string:\n\n   - **Lines to change:** The entire logic after the first approach\n   \n   - **New approach:**\n     - Track positions where we have 2+ consecutive `[` \n     - Track positions where we have 2+ consecutive `]`\n     - Ensure at least one `[` sequence position is before at least one `]` sequence position\n     \n   - **Alternative simpler fix:**\n     - Do a single forward pass\n     - Track when we see 2+ consecutive `[`\n     - After seeing 2+ consecutive `[`, check if we later encounter 2+ consecutive `]`\n     - This ensures proper ordering\n\n3. **Specific implementation:**\n   ```\n   - Scan left to right\n   - Count consecutive '[' - if count >= 2, set a flag\n   - When we hit ']', reset the '[' counter\n   - Count consecutive ']' - if count >= 2 AND flag is set, return True\n   - Return False if we never find the pattern\n   ```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\nThis ensures the opening brackets come before the closing brackets, which is necessary to form a valid nested structure like `[[]]`.",
