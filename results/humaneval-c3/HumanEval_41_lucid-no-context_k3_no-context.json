      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a **syntax error** caused by the docstring not being properly terminated.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring in the implementation is not properly closed. The opening `\"\"\"` on line ~8 doesn't have a matching closing `\"\"\"`, causing Python to treat the subsequent code as part of the string literal.\n\n**Fix**: \n- **Line ~19** (after \"This function outputs the number of such collisions.\"): Add the closing `\"\"\"` to properly terminate the docstring\n- Remove the duplicate docstring content that appears before the function definition\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. The docstring should end with `\"\"\"` immediately after \"This function outputs the number of such collisions.\"\n2. Remove lines 1-21 (the explanatory text and key observations) - these should not be inside the function\n3. Keep only the function definition starting with `def car_race_collision(n: int):`, its docstring (properly closed), and the return statement\n\n**Why this fixes it**: \n- Properly closing the docstring allows Python to parse the function correctly\n- The logic (`return n * n`) is actually correct for the problem - each of n left-to-right cars collides with each of n right-to-left cars, giving n\u00b2 total collisions\n- The syntax error is the only issue preventing the code from running",
