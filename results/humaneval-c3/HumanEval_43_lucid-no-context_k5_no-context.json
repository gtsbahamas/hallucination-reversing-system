      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains unescaped text that's being interpreted as Python code instead of comments. The lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Let me trace through...\" are not properly commented out.\n\n**Fix**: \n- **Lines to change**: Lines 1-13 (the explanation text before the function definition)\n- **What to do**: Either:\n  1. Remove these lines entirely (they're not needed in the actual code), OR\n  2. Prefix each line with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n\n**Recommended fix**: Remove lines 1-13 completely, keeping only the function definition starting with `def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):`.\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The Python interpreter is trying to parse the plain English text as Python code. The line \"Here's my approach:\" contains an apostrophe which starts a string literal that never gets closed, causing the `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal`. Removing or commenting out this explanatory text will allow the actual function code to be parsed correctly.\n\n**Note**: The actual algorithm implementation (lines 14-22 in the current code) appears correct and doesn't need changes - it properly uses a set to track seen numbers and checks for negatives.",
