      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains plain text comments that aren't properly formatted as Python comments or strings. The lines starting with numbers (1., 2., 3., etc.) and the example traces are being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove or comment out lines 1-14 (all the explanatory text before the actual function definition)\n\n**The fix:**\n- Delete lines 1-14 entirely (from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Here's the implementation:\")\n- Keep only the actual function implementation starting with `def words_in_sentence(sentence):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe explanatory text isn't valid Python syntax. It's causing a `SyntaxError` because Python is trying to parse it as code. The actual function implementation (lines 15-27) is correct and will work once the non-code text is removed.\n\nThe function logic itself is sound:\n- `is_prime()` correctly identifies prime numbers\n- Words are filtered by prime length\n- Order is preserved\n- Results are joined with spaces",
