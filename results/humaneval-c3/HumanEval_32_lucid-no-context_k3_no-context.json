      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has a syntax error because the multi-line explanation text is not properly formatted as a comment or removed.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 20-30 (the explanation text before the function implementation)\n\n**What to do**: Remove or comment out all the explanatory text that appears between the docstring and the actual function implementation. The text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...efficient for finding roots.\" should be deleted entirely.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Delete lines containing:\n   - \"Looking at this problem, I need to find a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients.\"\n   - \"Key observations:\"\n   - \"1. The polynomial has an even number of coefficients\"\n   - \"2. The largest (highest degree) coefficient is non-zero\"\n   - \"3. This guarantees at least one real solution exists\"\n   - \"Since we have these guarantees, I can use a numerical method like Newton-Raphson or bisection. Given the constraints, I'll use Newton-Raphson method which is efficient for finding roots.\"\n   - \"For Newton-Raphson, I need:\"\n   - \"- The polynomial function (already have via `poly`)\"\n   - \"- The derivative of the polynomial\"\n   - \"The derivative of a polynomial with coefficients `xs` is a polynomial with coefficients where the i-th coefficient becomes `i * xs[i]`.\"\n\n2. The function definition `def find_zero(xs: list):` should immediately follow the previous function's implementation, with the docstring directly after it, then the actual code.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: Python doesn't allow unquoted text in the code. All explanatory text must be either in comments (starting with `#`) or in string literals (docstrings). The current code has plain text that Python tries to interpret as code, causing a syntax error.",
