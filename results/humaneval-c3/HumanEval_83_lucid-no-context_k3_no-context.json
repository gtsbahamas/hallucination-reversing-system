      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring contains unescaped characters that are being interpreted as code, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 3-17 (the entire docstring/comment block)\n\n**The fix**:\n1. Remove all the explanatory text that's currently outside the docstring\n2. Keep only the actual function docstring (lines 2-5 in the original specification)\n3. The implementation code (lines 6-20 in the current version) is correct and should remain unchanged\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe current code has explanatory comments written as plain text outside of a docstring or comment markers. Python is trying to parse lines like `1. **Numbers starting with 1**: ...` as code, which causes a syntax error due to the unescaped quotes and invalid syntax.\n\n**Specific change**:\nReplace lines 3-17 with nothing (delete them), keeping only:\n- Line 2-5: The original docstring\n- Lines 6-20: The implementation (which is algorithmically correct)\n\nThe implementation logic itself is sound - it correctly uses inclusion-exclusion principle to count n-digit numbers starting or ending with 1.",
