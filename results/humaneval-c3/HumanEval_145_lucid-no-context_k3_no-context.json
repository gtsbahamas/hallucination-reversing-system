      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The error is a syntax error caused by a Unicode arrow character (\u2192) in a comment that was accidentally included in the code file.\n\n**Fix**:\n1. **Remove or fix the problematic comment** on line 26 that contains the `\u2192` character\n2. The comment appears to be leftover reasoning text that shouldn't be in the final code\n3. Either delete the entire comment line or replace `\u2192` with ASCII characters like `->` if the comment is needed\n\n**Why this fixes it**: \n- Python source files must use valid ASCII/UTF-8 characters in a way that doesn't break syntax\n- The `\u2192` character in what appears to be a comment is causing a syntax error\n- The actual implementation logic looks correct based on the specification, so only the comment needs to be cleaned up\n\n**Specific change**:\n- Delete line 26 (and any other explanatory comment lines that were accidentally left in from the reasoning phase)\n- Keep only the actual function implementation without the analysis comments",
