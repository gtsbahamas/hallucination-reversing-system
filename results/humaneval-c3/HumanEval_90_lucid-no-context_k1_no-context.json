The parser sees \"2nd\" and tries to parse it as a number literal, causing the \"invalid decimal literal\" error. Python files should only contain valid Python syntax (code, comments with `#`, or docstrings within triple quotes).\n\n**Result**: The file should start directly with:\n```python\ndef next_smallest(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a list of integers.\n    ...\n```\n\nThe actual implementation logic is correct and doesn't need changes.",
