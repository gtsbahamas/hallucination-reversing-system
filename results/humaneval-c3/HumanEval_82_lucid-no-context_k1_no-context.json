The arrow character (\u2192) and the entire explanation block are not valid Python syntax. The actual implementation logic is correct - it properly checks if a number is prime by:\n1. Handling edge cases (< 2, == 2)\n2. Checking divisibility by 2\n3. Checking odd divisors up to \u221an\n\nOnce the explanatory text is removed, the function will execute correctly.",
