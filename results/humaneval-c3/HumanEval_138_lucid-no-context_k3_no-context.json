      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains non-Python text (explanation/reasoning) that should be comments or removed entirely. The `\u2265` character and prose are causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove all the explanatory text between the function definition and the return statement (lines that start with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"So the condition is...\").\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Delete all lines from \"Looking at this problem...\" down to \"So the condition is: n must be even AND n must be at least 8.\"\n- Keep only the function definition and the return statement\n- Optionally, convert key insights to Python comments using `#` if documentation is desired\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe explanatory prose is not valid Python syntax. Python requires actual code statements or properly formatted comments (starting with `#`). The `\u2265` symbol and natural language text cannot appear as bare statements in Python code. Removing this text leaves only valid Python syntax: the function definition and return statement.\n\n**Result after fix**:\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    Example\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    \"\"\"\n    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0\n```",
