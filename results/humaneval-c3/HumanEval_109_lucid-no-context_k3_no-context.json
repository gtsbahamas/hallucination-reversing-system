      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains a syntax error due to improperly formatted comments in the docstring/comments section. The character `\u2264` in the comment is causing issues with string parsing.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n1. **Lines to change**: The implementation code itself is correct. The issue is in the comment/explanation section that was included before the function definition.\n\n2. **What to fix**: Remove or properly format the explanatory text that appears before the function definition. The actual function code (lines starting with `def move_one_ball(arr):` through `return arr[-1] <= arr[0]`) is correct and should be kept as-is.\n\n3. **Specific change**: Delete or move the explanatory text (the \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...not a rotation of sorted array \u2717\" section) outside of the Python code, or format it as proper Python comments using `#` at the start of each line.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The syntax error occurs because the explanatory text with special characters (like `\u2264`) is being interpreted as Python code rather than comments. The actual algorithm implementation is correct - it properly:\n- Handles empty arrays\n- Counts break points where arr[i] > arr[i+1]\n- Returns True for 0 break points (already sorted)\n- Returns False for >1 break points (not a rotation)\n- Checks arr[-1] <= arr[0] for exactly 1 break point (valid rotation)\n\n**Implementation**: Keep only the function definition and its body, removing the explanatory prose that precedes it.",
