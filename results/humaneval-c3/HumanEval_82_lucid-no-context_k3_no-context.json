      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is correct, but there's explanatory text mixed into the function definition that's causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove lines 18-21 (the trace-through examples that start with \"Let me trace through...\")\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Delete the entire block starting with \"Let me trace through the examples:\" through \"- 'orange' has length 6...\"\n- These are comments/explanations that should either be:\n  1. Removed entirely, OR\n  2. Moved outside the function definition, OR  \n  3. Converted to proper Python comments using `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe arrow character `\u2192` and the bullet points are not valid Python syntax. This explanatory text was meant to be part of the reasoning process, not actual code. The function implementation itself (lines starting with `def prime_length(string):` through the final `return True`) is correct and doesn't need modification - it just needs to be separated from the explanatory prose.\n\n**Result**: Keep only the actual function definition:\n```python\ndef prime_length(string):\n    length = len(string)\n    \n    if length < 2:\n        return False\n    \n    if length == 2:\n        return True\n    \n    if length % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    for i in range(3, int(length ** 0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if length % i == 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n```",
