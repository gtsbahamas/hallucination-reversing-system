      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation contains explanatory text that isn't valid Python syntax. The actual code logic is correct, but it needs to be pure Python without the prose explanation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 1-18 of the `decode_cyclic` function implementation\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove all the explanatory prose text (the \"Looking at...\" paragraph) and keep only the actual Python code. The function should contain:\n1. The docstring\n2. The line that splits the string into groups of 3\n3. The line that reverse-cycles groups of length 3\n4. The return statement\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe SyntaxError occurs because plain English text was included in the function body without being in a comment or string. Python tried to parse \"Looking at the...\" as code, which is invalid syntax. The actual decoding logic (`group[-1] + group[:-1]`) is correct - it reverses the encoding by moving the last character to the front for groups of 3 characters.",
