The code should start directly with:\n\n```python\ndef sort_third(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that...\"\"\"\n    if not l:\n        return l\n    # ... rest of implementation\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:** \nThe text \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\" and the subsequent explanation are not valid Python syntax. They're causing a SyntaxError because Python is trying to parse them as code. This explanatory text should either be:\n1. Removed entirely (recommended for production code)\n2. Converted to comments (prefix each line with `#`)\n3. Placed in the docstring\n\nThe actual implementation logic (lines 12 onwards in the current code) appears correct based on the specification, so only the non-code text needs to be removed.",
