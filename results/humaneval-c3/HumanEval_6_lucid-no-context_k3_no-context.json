      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a **syntax error** caused by the docstring format in the implementation. The issue is that the docstring uses triple quotes `\"\"\"` but the surrounding context (likely from the test file) is causing a string literal termination problem.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 2-7 (the docstring)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove or simplify the docstring in the implementation. The docstring is already defined in the specification, so having it duplicated in the implementation is causing the syntax error.\n\n**Specific change:**\nReplace lines 2-7 with either:\n- Option 1: Remove the docstring entirely (just start with the function body)\n- Option 2: Use a simple single-line comment instead\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because the triple-quoted docstring is conflicting with how the code is being evaluated in the test environment. The test framework likely already has the function specification with its docstring, and adding another docstring creates a string literal parsing issue. Removing the duplicate docstring will eliminate the syntax error.\n\n**Recommended implementation structure:**\n```python\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    groups = paren_string.split()\n    result = []\n    \n    for group in groups:\n        current_depth = 0\n        max_depth = 0\n        \n        for char in group:\n            if char == '(':\n                current_depth += 1\n                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)\n            elif char == ')':\n                current_depth -= 1\n        \n        result.append(max_depth)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThe logic itself is correct; only the docstring needs to be removed.",
