      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\nThe error is a **syntax error** caused by non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in what appears to be comments or documentation that got included in the actual code file.\n\n**Lines to change:**\n- Remove or comment out lines 37-41 (the trace-through examples that contain \u2192 characters)\n\n**The fix:**\nThese lines appear to be analysis/working notes that were accidentally left in the code file without proper comment syntax (`#`). They need to be either:\n1. Deleted entirely, OR\n2. Properly commented with `#` at the start of each line\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe Python interpreter is trying to parse lines containing `\u2192` (Unicode character U+2192) as Python code, which is invalid syntax. These are clearly meant to be comments/notes, not executable code. Removing them or properly commenting them will allow the code to parse and run.\n\n**Specific action:**\nDelete lines 37-41 (or wherever the trace-through examples starting with \"- intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))...\" appear in the actual file).\n\nThe actual function implementation (the `def intersection(...)` block) looks correct and doesn't need changes - it's just the extraneous analysis text that needs to be removed.",
