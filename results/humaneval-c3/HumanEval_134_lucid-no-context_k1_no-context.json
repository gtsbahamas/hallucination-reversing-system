      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure and specification, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Problem\nThe function returns `False` for a single alphabetical character like `\"A\"`, but according to the specification, this should return `True`. A single letter that is not part of a word (i.e., stands alone) should qualify.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Lines 17-18 (the single character check)\n\n**Current logic:**\n```python\nif len(txt) == 1:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```python\nif len(txt) == 1:\n    return True\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- A single alphabetical character is by definition \"not part of a word\" in the sense that it's isolated\n- The specification says the character should be \"not a part of a word\" where a \"word\" is defined as \"a group of characters separated by space\"\n- A single letter with no adjacent non-space characters satisfies this condition\n- The test `assert candidate(\"A\") == True` confirms this interpretation\n- The existing examples don't contradict this: `\"apple pie\"` ends with 'e' which is part of \"pie\" (False), `\"apple pi e\"` ends with 'e' preceded by space (True), `\"apple pi e \"` ends with space (False), and `\"\"` is empty (False)\n\nThis single-line change from `return False` to `return True` will make the function pass the failing test while maintaining correctness for all other cases.",
