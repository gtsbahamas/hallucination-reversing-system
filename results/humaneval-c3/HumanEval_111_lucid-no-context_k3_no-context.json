      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation contains prose/comments written as plain text outside of Python comment syntax, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 15-24 (the entire prose section before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the prose text that appears before the function definition. The actual function implementation (lines 25-44) is correct and should be kept as-is.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- Delete lines 15-24 (from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...return only 'b'\")\n- Keep only the function definition starting with `def histogram(test):` and its implementation\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe prose text is not valid Python syntax. It should either be:\n1. Removed entirely (recommended), or\n2. Converted to proper Python comments using `#` prefix\n\nThe actual logic in the function implementation is correct and handles all the test cases properly. The only issue is the syntax error from the uncommented prose text.",
