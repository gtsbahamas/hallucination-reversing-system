      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is embedded within a multi-line string (docstring or comment) that isn't properly terminated, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Remove or properly terminate any string literal that contains \"Here's the implementation:\" around line 29\n- **The fix**: The actual function implementation (lines with `if not test:`, `letters = test.split()`, etc.) should be at the proper indentation level directly under the function definition, NOT inside a string literal\n- **Why this fixes it**: The code logic itself appears correct, but it's currently trapped inside an unterminated string. Moving it to be actual executable code (not a string) will resolve the syntax error.\n\n**Specific action**: \nDelete any opening quote/string delimiter before \"Looking at this problem\" or \"Here's the implementation:\" and ensure the function body starts immediately after the docstring ends (after the `\"\"\"` closing the specification). The implementation code should be indented 4 spaces from the `def` line.",
