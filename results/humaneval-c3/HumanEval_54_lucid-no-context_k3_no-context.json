      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error is a syntax error caused by non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in the docstring/comments that are being interpreted as code rather than comments.\n\n**Root Cause**: The implementation explanation text is not properly formatted as a comment or docstring. It appears to be written as plain text outside of any string or comment block, causing Python to try to parse it as code.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Remove or properly comment out lines 2-11 (the explanation text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the bullet points)\n- **What to do**: Either:\n  1. Delete these lines entirely (they're not needed in the final implementation), OR\n  2. Move them inside a multi-line comment using `\"\"\"` or prefix each line with `#`\n\n**Recommended fix**: Delete lines 2-11 completely, keeping only:\n- Line 1: The function definition\n- The docstring (lines that are already inside the `\"\"\"` block)\n- Line with `return set(s0) == set(s1)`\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The implementation logic (`return set(s0) == set(s1)`) is actually correct. The only issue is the syntax error from improperly formatted explanatory text. Removing this text will allow the function to execute properly.",
