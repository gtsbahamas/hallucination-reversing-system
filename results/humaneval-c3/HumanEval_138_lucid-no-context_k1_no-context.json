      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains non-ASCII characters (\u2265) in what appears to be a comment that's not properly formatted as a Python comment.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 11-13 (the explanation text before the return statement)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or properly comment out the explanation text that contains the \u2265 symbol and other prose. This text appears to be documentation/reasoning that wasn't converted to Python comments.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Delete lines 11-13 (the text starting with \"If n \u2265 8...\" through \"...positive even number\")\n2. Alternatively, prefix each of these lines with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \n- Python doesn't allow non-ASCII characters like \u2265 in code outside of strings/comments\n- The text appears to be explanatory prose that should either be removed or converted to comments\n- The actual logic in the return statement (line 14) is correct and doesn't need modification\n\n**Corrected function should be**:\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    Example\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    \"\"\"\n    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0\n```",
