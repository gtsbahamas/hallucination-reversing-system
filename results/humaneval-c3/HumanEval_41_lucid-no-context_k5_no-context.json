      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a **syntax error** caused by improperly formatted text within the function body.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** Lines 14-20 contain plain text comments that are not properly formatted as Python comments or strings. Python is interpreting them as code, and the apostrophe in \"they don't stop\" is being treated as an unterminated string literal.\n\n**Solution:** Remove lines 14-20 (the \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...n \u00d7 n = n\u00b2\" text block).\n\n**Specific changes:**\n- **Delete lines 14-20** (all the explanatory text between the docstring and the return statement)\n- Keep only:\n  - The function signature (line 13)\n  - The docstring (lines 14-24 of original, which should remain)\n  - The return statement: `return n * n`\n\n**Why this fixes it:** The implementation logic (`return n * n`) is actually correct. The only issue is the improperly formatted explanatory text that should have been removed or commented out with `#` symbols. Removing this text will eliminate the syntax error while preserving the correct solution.\n\n**Final structure should be:**\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    [docstring content]\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * n\n```",
