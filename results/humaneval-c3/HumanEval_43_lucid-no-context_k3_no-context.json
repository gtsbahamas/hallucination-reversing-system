      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains markdown-style comments (lines starting with `-`) which are not valid Python syntax. These need to be removed or converted to proper Python comments.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove or comment out lines 32-35 (the bullet-point trace examples that appear after the function definition)\n\n**Specific fix**:\n1. Delete lines 32-35 entirely (the markdown-style trace examples)\n   - OR convert them to Python comments by prefixing each line with `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \n- Python doesn't recognize markdown syntax (lines starting with `-`)\n- These lines were meant to be explanatory comments but weren't properly formatted as Python comments\n- The actual function implementation (lines 37-42) is correct and doesn't need changes\n- Once the syntax error is removed, the logic will work correctly: it uses a set to track seen numbers and checks if the negative of the current number was already seen, which correctly identifies pairs that sum to zero\n\n**Note**: The function logic itself is sound and will pass the tests once the syntax error is fixed.",
