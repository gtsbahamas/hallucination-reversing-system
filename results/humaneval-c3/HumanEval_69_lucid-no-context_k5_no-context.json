      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a syntax error because the docstring is not properly terminated. The implementation code appears after the docstring's closing `'''`, but the docstring itself seems to be malformed in the actual file.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring is not properly closed, causing Python to interpret the subsequent code as part of the string literal.\n\n**Fix**: \n- **Line 1-13**: Ensure the docstring has proper opening `'''` on line 2 and closing `'''` on line 13\n- The docstring should be the only thing between lines 2-13\n- The implementation code (starting with `from collections import Counter`) should begin on line 14, AFTER the docstring closes\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Remove all the explanatory text and trace-through examples that appear between the docstring and the implementation\n2. The structure should be:\n   ```python\n   def search(lst):\n       '''\n       [docstring content]\n       '''\n       from collections import Counter\n       # ... rest of implementation\n   ```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The syntax error occurs because there's text outside of proper Python syntax (the numbered list and trace-through) that's being interpreted as code. By ensuring only the docstring and implementation exist, with proper string delimiters, the syntax error will be resolved.\n\nThe actual implementation logic (using Counter, checking `count >= num`, tracking max) is correct and doesn't need changes.",
