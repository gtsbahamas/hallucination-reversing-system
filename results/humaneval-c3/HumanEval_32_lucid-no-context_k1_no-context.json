      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation has prose text mixed with code, which causes a syntax error. The explanation text needs to be removed or converted to comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire implementation section (lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the function definition)\n\n**What to fix:**\n1. Remove all the prose explanation text that appears before and within the code\n2. Keep only the actual Python function definition with proper syntax\n3. The logic itself is correct - just needs the non-code text removed\n\n**Specific changes:**\n- Delete lines: \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Newton-Raphson iteration: `x_new = x_old - f(x_old) / f'(x_old)`\"\n- Keep only the function definition starting with `def find_zero(xs: list):`\n- Ensure the nested `poly_derivative` function and the Newton-Raphson implementation remain intact\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe Python interpreter is trying to parse the English explanation text as Python code, causing a syntax error. Removing the prose and keeping only valid Python code will allow the function to execute properly. The actual algorithm implementation appears sound - it's just wrapped in invalid syntax.",
