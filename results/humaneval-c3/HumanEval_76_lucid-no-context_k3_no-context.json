      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue - the comment contains an apostrophe that's terminating a string literal. But more importantly, I can see the actual implementation has logical issues.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire implementation needs restructuring, but specifically:\n\n1. **Remove the syntax error** (line 30): The comment with an apostrophe is causing issues, but this appears to be outside the function definition.\n\n2. **Fix the core logic** (lines 15-40): The current approach has several problems:\n   - For `n > 1`, it doesn't handle negative `x` values (e.g., `x=1, n=2` works, but the logic for `x < 1` is wrong)\n   - For `n < -1`, the logic for checking even/odd powers is overly complex and incorrect\n   - The iterative multiplication approach can overflow or be inefficient\n\n**Recommended fix:**\n\nReplace the entire function body with a simpler approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_simple_power(x, n):\n    # Edge case: n = 1\n    if n == 1:\n        return x == 1\n    \n    # Edge case: n = 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return x == 0 or x == 1\n    \n    # Edge case: n = -1\n    if n == -1:\n        return x == 1 or x == -1\n    \n    # Edge case: x = 1 (n^0 = 1 for any n != 0)\n    if x == 1:\n        return True\n    \n    # For other cases, iterate through powers\n    power = n\n    # Limit iterations to prevent infinite loops\n    for _ in range(100):\n        if power == x:\n            return True\n        if abs(power) > abs(x):\n            break\n        power *= n\n    \n    return False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- Removes syntax error by eliminating problematic comments\n- Simplifies the logic to handle all cases uniformly\n- Uses iteration with a safety limit instead of complex conditional logic\n- Correctly handles negative bases and results\n- The loop naturally handles both positive and negative powers by checking if `power == x` at each step",
