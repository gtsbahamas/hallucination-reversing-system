      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation code contains the specification/explanation text with special characters (\u2192) that Python can't parse. The actual function implementation is correct, but it's mixed with the explanation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code file contains explanation text with Unicode arrow characters (\u2192) that causes a syntax error. The function implementation itself is correct but needs to be separated from the explanation.\n\n**Fix**: \n- Remove lines 2-21 (all the explanation text starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" through the vowel tracing examples)\n- Keep only the actual function implementation starting from line 23 (`def encode(message):`)\n- The function logic itself is correct and doesn't need changes\n\n**Why this fixes it**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the explanation text as code. The arrow character `\u2192` and the explanation format are not valid Python syntax. Removing this text leaves only the valid function definition, which will execute correctly.\n\nThe actual implementation logic is sound:\n1. It swaps case first\n2. Then checks if the swapped character is a vowel\n3. If yes, shifts it 2 places ahead in ASCII\n4. Otherwise keeps the swapped character",
