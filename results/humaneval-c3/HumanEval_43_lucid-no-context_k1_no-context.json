      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains the docstring/comments from the reasoning section, which creates a syntax error. The numbered list item `2. Make sure we're looking at distinct elements (different positions)` is being interpreted as Python code.\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the reasoning text that appears before the actual function definition.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines**: Remove everything from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...\u2192 False\" (the entire reasoning section before the function)\n- **Keep**: Only the function definition starting with `def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):` and its docstring\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The reasoning text contains unquoted strings and syntax that isn't valid Python. The actual implementation logic (using a set to track seen numbers and checking for negatives) is correct and will work once the extraneous text is removed.\n\nThe core algorithm is sound:\n1. Iterate through the list\n2. Check if the negative of current number was seen before\n3. Add current number to the seen set\n4. Return True if a pair is found, False otherwise",
