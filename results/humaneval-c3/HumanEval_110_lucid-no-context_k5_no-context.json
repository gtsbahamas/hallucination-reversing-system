The error message shows that there's text outside the function definition that's being interpreted as Python code.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation reasoning text (\"Looking at this problem...\") is placed outside the function definition and is being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Solution**: Remove all the explanatory text that appears before the function definition. Only keep the actual Python function code.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines**: Remove all text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...so 'NO'\" (the entire explanation block before the function)\n- **Keep**: Only the function definition starting with `def exchange(lst1, lst2):` and its implementation\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The explanatory text is not valid Python syntax. It should either be:\n1. Removed entirely (recommended for production code)\n2. Placed inside the docstring\n3. Converted to comments with `#` prefix\n\nThe actual logic of the implementation is correct - it counts total even numbers across both lists and checks if there are enough to fill lst1. The only issue is the placement of the explanation text.",
