      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code has a syntax error due to an unterminated string literal in the docstring.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 10 (the docstring)\n\n**The fix**:\n```python\nfind_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\" ,\"cc\"]) == \"aaaaaaa\"\n```\n\nChange the closing quotes from `\"\"aaaaaaa\"` to `\"aaaaaaa\"` (remove the extra opening quote before \"aaaaaaa\").\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe docstring has a typo with double opening quotes (`\"\"aaaaaaa\"`), which causes Python to interpret the string as unterminated. The parser sees the first `\"` as closing the string, then encounters another `\"` which opens a new string that never gets closed, leading to the syntax error on the next line.\n\n**Additional issue to address** (once syntax is fixed):\n\nThe sorting logic is incorrect. The current implementation uses:\n- `(len(set(word)), -ord(word[0]), [-ord(c) for c in word])`\n\nThis sorts by:\n1. Maximum unique characters (correct)\n2. Reverse of first character (incorrect approach)\n3. Reverse of all characters (incorrect approach)\n\n**Correct fix for line with `return max(...)`**:\n```python\nreturn max(words, key=lambda word: (len(set(word)), [-ord(c) for c in word]))\n```\n\nOr more simply:\n```python\nreturn max(words, key=lambda word: (len(set(word)), word.lower()), reverse=True)[0] if words else \"\"\n```\n\nWait, simpler approach:\n```python\nreturn max(words, key=lambda word: (len(set(word)), -len(word), word))\n```\n\nActually, the requirement is: max unique chars, then lexicographically smallest. So:\n```python\nreturn max(words, key=lambda word: (len(set(word)), [-ord(c) for c in word]))\n```\n\nThis maximizes unique chars, then maximizes the negated character codes (which gives lexicographically smallest).",
