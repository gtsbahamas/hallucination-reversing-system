      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's explanatory text that wasn't properly commented out or removed before the function definition. The Python interpreter is trying to parse the explanation as code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The explanatory text between the docstring and the actual function implementation needs to be removed or commented out.\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Remove all the explanatory text that appears after the docstring (starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...= 0 \u2713\")\n2. Keep only the actual function implementation starting with `def max_fill(grid, capacity):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to interpret plain English text as Python code. The text \"For each well (row), I need to count...\" contains characters like parentheses and commas that Python tries to parse as code syntax, resulting in \"invalid decimal literal\" when it encounters \"1s\" (which looks like it could be a number but isn't valid).\n\nThe actual implementation logic is correct (as evidenced by the trace-through examples working), but it's being preceded by uncommented explanatory text that should either be:\n- Removed entirely, or\n- Placed inside the docstring, or  \n- Commented out with `#` symbols\n\nThe cleanest solution is to remove the explanatory text entirely since the docstring already explains the function's purpose.",
