      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation contains explanatory text that's not in a comment or string, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 18-31 (the entire current implementation section)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove all the explanatory prose text and keep only the actual Python function implementation. The function logic itself is correct - it just needs to be properly formatted as code without the narrative explanation mixed in.\n\n**Specific changes:**\n1. Delete lines 18-27 (all the \"Looking at...\" explanatory text)\n2. Keep only the function definition starting from line 29:\n   ```python\n   def decode_cyclic(s: str):\n       \"\"\"\n       takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n       \"\"\"\n       # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n       groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n       # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.\n       groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n       return \"\".join(groups)\n   ```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse plain English text as code. The actual decoding logic (`group[-1] + group[:-1]`) is correct - it moves the last character to the front, which reverses the encoding operation. We just need to remove the non-code explanation.",
