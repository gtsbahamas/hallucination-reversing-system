      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation code contains **comments written as plain text instead of Python comments**. The lines starting with `-` are being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 2-4 in the implementation (the bullet points)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove or properly comment out these lines:\n```\n- Count the number of 1s (water units)\n- Divide by bucket capacity and round up to get the number of trips needed\n```\n\nThese are documentation/explanation lines that were accidentally left in the code body. They should either be:\n1. Removed entirely (since they're just planning notes), OR\n2. Converted to proper Python comments by prefixing with `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nPython is trying to parse `- Count the number...` as code. The `-` followed by text creates an \"invalid decimal literal\" syntax error. Removing these lines leaves only valid Python code (the actual implementation starting with `total_trips = 0`).\n\n**Note:** The actual algorithm implementation (lines 5-9) appears correct based on the examples traced through. Only the non-code text needs to be removed.",
