      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has Python code mixed with natural language comments outside of proper comment syntax, causing a SyntaxError.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-5 (the explanation text before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove or comment out the explanatory text that appears before the function definition. The text starting with \"Looking at the examples...\" through \"...wrapping around if necessary.\" needs to be either:\n1. Deleted entirely, OR\n2. Converted to proper Python comments by prefixing each line with `#`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: Python cannot parse plain English text that isn't in a string or comment. The SyntaxError occurs because the interpreter tries to execute \"Looking at the examples...\" as Python code. The actual function logic (lines 6-20) is correct and implements the shift-by-4 encryption properly.\n\n**Recommended action**: Simply delete lines 1-5 entirely, keeping only the function definition starting from `def encrypt(s):`.",
