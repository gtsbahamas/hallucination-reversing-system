      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains plain text comments that aren't properly formatted as Python comments. The lines starting with numbers (1., 2., 3., etc.) and the example traces are being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove or comment out lines 1-24 (all the explanatory text before the function definition)\n\n**The fix:**\n- Delete all the plain text explanation before the `def words_in_sentence(sentence):` line\n- OR prefix each explanatory line with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n- Keep only the actual function implementation (lines starting from `def words_in_sentence(sentence):`)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe current code has unquoted text that Python tries to parse as code. Python expects either:\n- Valid Python syntax\n- Comments (lines starting with `#`)\n- Strings (enclosed in quotes)\n\nThe plain text \"1. Split the sentence into words\" etc. is none of these, causing the syntax error. The actual function logic appears correct based on the examples, so only the formatting needs to be fixed.\n\n**Corrected structure should be:**\n```python\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        # ... (existing implementation)\n    \n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)\n```",
