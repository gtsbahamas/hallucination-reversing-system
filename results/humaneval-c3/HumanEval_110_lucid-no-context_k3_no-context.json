      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's explanatory text outside the function that Python is trying to parse as code.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation includes explanatory comments and reasoning outside the function definition, which Python interprets as invalid syntax.\n\n**Solution**: Remove all the explanatory text that appears before and between the function definition. Keep only the actual Python code.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. **Delete lines**: Remove all text from \"Looking at this problem...\" up to (but not including) the second `def exchange(lst1, lst2):` line\n2. **Keep**: Only the function definition starting with `def exchange(lst1, lst2):` and its implementation\n\n**Why this fixes it**: Python expects valid Python syntax, not prose explanations. The text \"Looking at this problem...\" is being interpreted as a statement, causing a syntax error. The function implementation itself is correct; it just needs to stand alone without the surrounding explanation.\n\nThe actual logic (counting total even numbers and comparing to lst1's length) is sound and matches the specification correctly.",
