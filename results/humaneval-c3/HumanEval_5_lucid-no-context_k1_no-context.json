The function signature\n  2. The docstring\n  3. The actual implementation code (the `if not numbers:` block and the loop)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe explanation text contains invalid Python syntax (like the arrow character `\u2192` and markdown formatting). This text should be a comment or removed entirely, not placed as executable code within the function body. The actual implementation logic (starting with `if not numbers:`) is correct and will work once the explanatory text is removed.",
