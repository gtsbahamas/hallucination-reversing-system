      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code contains a syntax error due to a multiplication symbol (\u00d7) in a comment that's being interpreted as code.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 22 (and similar lines with the \u00d7 symbol in comments)\n\n**The fix**:\n1. **Line 22**: Change `- Count = 9 \u00d7 10^(n-2)` to `- Count = 9 * 10^(n-2)` in the comment\n2. **Line 19**: Change `- Count = 10^(n-1)` comment (already correct, but ensure consistency)\n3. **Line 25**: Change `- Count = 10^(n-2)` comment (already correct)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe error message shows that Python is encountering the Unicode multiplication symbol (\u00d7, U+00D7) on line 22 and treating it as invalid syntax. Even though these appear to be in comments, there may be an issue with how the comment is formatted or the character is being parsed. Replace all mathematical symbols in comments with ASCII equivalents:\n- Use `*` instead of `\u00d7` for multiplication\n- Use `^` or `**` for exponentiation (though `^` in comments is fine as-is)\n\n**Specific change needed**:\nReplace line 22's comment from:\n```python\n   - Count = 9 \u00d7 10^(n-2)\n```\nto:\n```python\n   - Count = 9 * 10^(n-2)\n```\n\nThis ensures all characters in the file are standard ASCII characters that Python can safely parse.",
