      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation has explanatory text mixed with the code, causing a syntax error. The actual logic appears correct, but it needs to be properly formatted as a Python function.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire implementation needs to be cleaned up to remove the prose explanation that's causing the syntax error.\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Remove all the explanatory text before and within the function (lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the trace example)\n2. Keep only the actual function definition starting with `def tri(n):`\n3. The logic itself (the actual code) is correct and should be preserved as-is\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse English prose as Python code. The line \"Looking at this problem, I need to understand...\" is not valid Python syntax. By removing all non-code text and keeping only the function definition and its body, the syntax error will be resolved.\n\n**Specific changes:**\n- Delete everything before `def tri(n):`\n- Keep the function body exactly as written (the if/else logic with the loop)\n- The algorithm logic is sound: it correctly handles tri(0)=1, tri(1)=3, even indices with `1 + i // 2`, and odd indices using the recurrence relation with the pre-calculated tri(i+1)",
