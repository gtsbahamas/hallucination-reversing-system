      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is mixed with explanation text, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the explanatory text and keep only the function definition.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines 1-28**: Remove all the explanation text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through the example calculations\n- **Keep only lines 29-41**: The actual function implementation starting with `def order_by_points(nums):` through the `return` statement\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe Python interpreter is trying to parse plain English text as Python code. By removing the explanation and keeping only the valid Python function definition, the syntax error will be resolved. The logic itself appears correct based on the analysis (handling negative numbers by making only the first digit negative), so only the formatting needs to be fixed.",
