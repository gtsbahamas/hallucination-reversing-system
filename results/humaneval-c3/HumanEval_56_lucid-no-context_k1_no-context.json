      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has a syntax error due to unescaped apostrophes in the docstring comments.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 23-26 (the comment block before the function)\n\n**The fix**:\nRemove or move the explanatory comments that are currently placed between the docstring and the function definition. These comments contain apostrophes that Python is interpreting as string delimiters, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Delete the comments entirely** (lines 23-26) - they're explanatory notes, not necessary for the code\n2. **Move them inside the function** as regular comments after the docstring\n3. **Move them above the function definition** before the docstring starts\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe text starting with \"I'll use a counter approach:\" appears to be outside any function or proper comment syntax. The apostrophe in \"I'll\" is being interpreted as starting a string literal that never closes, causing the SyntaxError. The actual function implementation (lines 28-39) is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\n**Recommended fix**: Simply delete lines 23-26 (the entire comment block starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"- Counter must be 0 at the end\"). The function implementation itself is already correct.",
