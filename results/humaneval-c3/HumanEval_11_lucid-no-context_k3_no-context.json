      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The comment on line 15 is not properly formatted as a Python comment. It's written as plain text, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Line 15**: Add a `#` at the beginning to make it a proper Python comment\n- Change from: `XOR returns 1 when bits are different, 0 when they're the same.`\n- Change to: `# XOR returns 1 when bits are different, 0 when they're the same.`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nIn Python, comments must start with `#`. Without it, the interpreter tries to parse the text as code, and the apostrophe in \"they're\" starts an unterminated string literal, causing the syntax error.\n\nThe actual XOR logic in the implementation is correct and doesn't need changes.",
