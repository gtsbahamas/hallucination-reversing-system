      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation has Python code mixed with natural language comments outside of strings, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-11 (the entire explanation section before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the natural language explanation text that appears before the function definition. The file should start directly with the function definition.\n\n**Specifically**:\n- Delete lines 1-11 (everything from \"Looking at this problem...\" through the trace example)\n- Keep only the function definition starting with `def sort_third(l: list):`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: Python files must contain valid Python syntax. The natural language explanation is not in a comment (not prefixed with `#`) or a string, so Python tries to parse it as code, resulting in a `SyntaxError`. Removing this text leaves only valid Python code.\n\nThe actual implementation logic appears correct based on the specification, so no changes to the function body are needed.",
