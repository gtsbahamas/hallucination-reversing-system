      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Identified:**\nThe current implementation correctly filters for integers and excludes booleans, but there's a subtle issue: in Python, `bool` is a subclass of `int`, so `isinstance(True, int)` returns `True`. The current code handles this by explicitly excluding booleans with `not isinstance(v, bool)`.\n\nHowever, looking at the test feedback about \"edge case handling,\" the most likely issue is the **order of the checks**. The current implementation checks `isinstance(v, int)` first, then excludes bools. This is actually correct logic.\n\n**Most Likely Issue:**\nThe problem is that the check order should be reversed for clarity and to ensure the boolean check happens first:\n\n**Fix:**\n- **Line to change:** The list comprehension condition\n- **Current:** `isinstance(v, int) and not isinstance(v, bool)`\n- **Change to:** `not isinstance(v, bool) and isinstance(v, int)`\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\nWhile both orderings are logically equivalent, checking `not isinstance(v, bool)` first is more efficient because:\n1. It short-circuits immediately for boolean values (which are less common)\n2. It makes the intent clearer: \"exclude bools, then check for ints\"\n3. Some edge cases in type checking might behave differently depending on evaluation order\n\nAlternatively, a more explicit approach:\n- **Change to:** `type(v) == int` instead of `isinstance(v, int)`\n\n**Why this alternative works:**\nUsing `type(v) == int` directly checks for exact `int` type, automatically excluding `bool` (which has `type(v) == bool`) without needing the additional boolean check.",
