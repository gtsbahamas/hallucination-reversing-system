This means lists like `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 2, 2, 3]` would return `True`, but these are not strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing - they're non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nHowever, based on the specification's wording \"monotonically increasing or decreasing\" and the test cases provided, the current implementation appears correct for those examples. The edge case issue is likely with **empty lists or single-element lists**.\n\n**Actual Issue**: Line 8 checks `if len(l) <= 1:` which would return `True` for empty lists. While this might be mathematically correct, it could be the edge case the test is flagging.\n\n**Alternative Issue**: If the specification requires *strictly* monotonic (no equal consecutive elements), then:\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 10-11\n\n**Fix**:\n```python\nincreasing = all(l[i] < l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1))\ndecreasing = all(l[i] > l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1))\n```\n\n**Why**: Change `<=` to `<` and `>=` to `>` to enforce strictly monotonic sequences (no equal consecutive elements allowed).\n\n**Most likely fix**: Change operators to strict inequalities, as \"monotonic\" typically means strictly increasing or strictly decreasing in computer science contexts.",
