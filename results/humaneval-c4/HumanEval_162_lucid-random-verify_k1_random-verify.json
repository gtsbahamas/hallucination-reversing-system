      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Identified:**\nThe function only checks for an empty string `''` but doesn't handle `None` input, which could cause an `AttributeError` when calling `.encode()` on `None`.\n\n**Lines to Change:**\n\n**Line 1 (the condition check):**\n```python\nif text == '':\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```python\nif not text:\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- `if not text:` handles both empty string `''` AND `None` input\n- When `text` is `None`, `not text` evaluates to `True`, returning `None` as expected\n- When `text` is `''`, `not text` also evaluates to `True`, returning `None` as specified\n- This prevents the `AttributeError` that would occur if `None.encode()` were called\n- The fix maintains the original behavior for empty strings while adding robustness for `None` inputs\n\n**Alternative consideration:**\nIf the specification strictly requires only empty strings to return `None` and `None` inputs should raise an error, then add explicit `None` check:\n```python\nif text is None or text == '':\n    return None\n```\n\nHowever, the more Pythonic `if not text:` is recommended as it handles both cases gracefully.",
