      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The loop range `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` stops at index 1, which means it never checks index 1 (the second character from the left). This causes the function to miss valid vowels at position 1 when they're between two consonants.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 19\n\n**Current code**:\n```python\nfor i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):\n```\n\n**Fix**:\n```python\nfor i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The range `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` actually goes from `len(word) - 2` down to `1` (inclusive), which should be correct since we want to exclude the first (index 0) and last (index len(word)-1) characters.\n\nLet me re-examine: The issue is that `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` stops **before** reaching 0, so it includes index 1. This is actually correct.\n\n**Actual Problem**: The range should be `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` which iterates indices from `len(word)-2` down to `1`. But we're checking `word[i-1]` and `word[i+1]`, so when `i=1`, we check `word[0]` and `word[2]`, which is correct.\n\nAfter reconsideration, the logic appears sound. The edge case issue might be with the stopping condition. Let me verify:\n\n**Actual Fix Needed**: None in the logic, but the range endpoint should ensure we check index 1.\n\nActually, `range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1)` generates: `len(word)-2, len(word)-3, ..., 2, 1` which is correct.\n\nThe implementation looks correct. The \"edge case\" failure might be a false positive or the test expectations are different. The code correctly excludes first and last positions and checks from right to left.",
