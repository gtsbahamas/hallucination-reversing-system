      "verification": "FAIL: The implementation has bugs in edge case handling.",
      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and specification, I need to identify the bug in edge case handling.\n\nLet me trace through the examples:\n- Example 1: \"This is a test\" \u2192 lengths: [4, 2, 1, 4] \u2192 prime lengths: [2] \u2192 \"is\" \u2713\n- Example 2: \"lets go for swimming\" \u2192 lengths: [4, 2, 3, 8] \u2192 prime lengths: [2, 3] \u2192 \"go for\" \u2713\n\nThe issue is likely with the **edge case of length 1**. Let me check:\n- Length 1: `is_prime(1)` returns `False` \u2713 (correct, 1 is not prime)\n\nWait - the actual bug is that **the specification says \"sentence contains only letters\"** but the implementation doesn't handle this constraint. However, looking more carefully at the test failure message about \"edge case handling,\" the most likely issue is:\n\n**The bug: The `is_prime` function incorrectly handles n=2.**\n\nActually, reviewing again - the `is_prime(2)` returns `True`, which is correct.\n\nThe real edge case bug is likely: **What if the sentence has multiple spaces between words?**\n\n`sentence.split()` handles multiple spaces correctly by default, so that's not it.\n\n**The actual bug: Length 1 words should be excluded, and they are. But the edge case is likely about the number 4.**\n\nLet me reconsider: 4 = 2\u00d72, so it's not prime. The function checks `n % 2 == 0` and returns False, which is correct.\n\n**The real issue: The function needs to handle the edge case where n=1 or n=2 more carefully, OR there's an issue with how composite numbers are checked.**\n\nAfter careful analysis, the bug is most likely in the **prime checking logic for small numbers**:\n\n## Fix Plan:\n\n**Line to change:** Line 3-4 in `is_prime` function\n\n**Current code:**\n```python\nif n < 2:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Issue:** This is actually correct. The real bug is that the function doesn't properly validate that 1 is not prime (which it does handle correctly).\n\n**Actual bug:** The edge case is likely that **the function should handle empty strings or sentences with only non-prime length words**, but reviewing the code, it does handle this correctly by returning an empty string.\n\n**Most likely bug after re-analysis:** The specification might expect different behavior for **length 2 words**. But 2 IS prime, so \"is\" and \"go\" should be included.\n\n**The actual fix needed:** None in the prime logic itself. The bug must be in how the result is formatted. If all words are filtered out, `\" \".join([])` returns `\"\"`, which is correct.\n\n**Final diagnosis:** The edge case is likely that **the function should return an empty string when no words have prime lengths**, which it already does correctly. The implementation appears correct as written.\n\nHowever, if tests are failing, the most likely overlooked edge case is:\n- **Empty sentence**: Already handled (returns \"\")\n- **Single word with non-prime length**: Already handled (returns \"\")\n\nThe implementation looks correct. Without seeing the actual failing test case, the code appears to properly handle all edge cases.",
