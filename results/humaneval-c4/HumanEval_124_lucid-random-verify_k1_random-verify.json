      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The function accepts invalid day values like `0` in dates such as `'04-0-2040'`, which should return `False` according to the specification example.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `int()` function successfully parses `'0'` as the integer `0`, but the day validation logic doesn't catch this because it only checks `day < 1`, which would be False for `day = 0`. However, the issue is that `'0'` is being parsed as `0`, and `0 < 1` should be True, so this should work...\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The actual issue is likely with **leading zeros or malformed numbers**. The string `'04-0-2040'` has `'0'` as the day, which parses to `0`, and `0 < 1` is `True`, so it should return `False`. But if the test is failing, there might be an issue with how we're handling the string parsing.\n\n**Actual Issue**: The problem is that `int('0')` returns `0`, and the condition `day < 1` should catch this. Let me check the logic flow again...\n\nActually, the logic seems correct for catching `day = 0`. The real issue must be with **string format validation** - the function doesn't validate that each part has the correct number of digits or format.\n\n**The Fix**:\n\nAdd validation to ensure:\n1. Month part has exactly 2 digits\n2. Day part has exactly 2 digits  \n3. Year part has exactly 4 digits\n4. No leading/trailing whitespace\n\n**Lines to change**: After line where `parts = date.split('-')` (around line 28-29)\n\n**Add these checks**:\n```\n# Validate format: mm-dd-yyyy (2-2-4 digits)\nif len(parts[0]) != 2 or len(parts[1]) != 2 or len(parts[2]) != 4:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The example `'04-0-2040'` has a day part `'0'` which is only 1 digit, not 2. This violates the `mm-dd-yyyy` format requirement where `dd` must be 2 digits.",
