The specification doesn't require type checking - it just says \"positive numbers\"\n2. The `isinstance` check may be filtering out valid numeric types (like `numpy` integers, `Decimal`, etc.)\n3. The comparison `x > 0` already implicitly handles numeric types through duck typing\n4. The test examples show the function should work with standard numeric inputs, and removing the type check makes it more flexible while still meeting the specification\n5. If a non-numeric type is in the list, the `> 0` comparison will naturally raise an error (which is appropriate) or return False for comparable types\n\nThis simpler implementation matches the specification exactly and handles all standard numeric types correctly.",
