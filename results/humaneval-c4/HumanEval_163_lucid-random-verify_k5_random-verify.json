Looking at the examples:\n- `generate_integers(10, 14) => []` suggests it should return even **single digits** (0-9), not even numbers in the range\n- The current implementation checks if digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 fall within [a, b]\n- For `generate_integers(10, 14)`, since 10 > 8, no digits qualify, returning `[]` \u2713\n- However, the issue is likely with **digit 0** being included\n\n**The Bug:**\nLine 13 includes `0` in the list of even digits to check.
