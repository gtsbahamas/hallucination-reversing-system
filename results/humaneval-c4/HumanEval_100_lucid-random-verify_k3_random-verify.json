Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, reviewing the code more carefully: **the implementation is correct** for the logic. The \"return type incorrect\" error is puzzling because it always returns a list.\n\n**Most likely issue**: The test might be checking for a specific scenario where:\n- Input validation is expected (e.g., n=0 should return empty list `[]`)\n- The current code with `range(0)` would return `[]` correctly\n\n**Actual Fix Needed**: None for the core logic - the implementation is correct. The function:\n1. Always returns a list \u2713\n2. Correctly implements the odd/even progression \u2713\n3. Creates n levels \u2713\n\n**If there truly is a test failure**, it might be:\n- A testing framework issue\n- Or the tests expect different behavior for n=0 or n=1\n\n**Recommendation**: The current implementation is correct as-is. If tests are failing, verify:\n1. Test framework compatibility\n2. Edge case expectations (n=0, n=1)\n3. That tests aren't expecting a different return type (tuple, generator, etc.)\n\nNo code changes needed - implementation matches specification perfectly.",
