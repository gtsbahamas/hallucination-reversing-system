When we do `.replace('i', str(count))`, it replaces **all** occurrences of the letter 'i' in the string, not just the placeholder 'i's.\n\n## Evidence from Examples\nIn the expected output `\"the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\"`, we can see:\n- \"in\" becomes \"4n\" \n- \"string\" becomes \"str4ng\"\n- \"input\" becomes \"4nput\"\n\nThis shows that only the standalone 'i' characters should be replaced, but the current implementation replaces every 'i' including those within words.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line 7\n```python\noutput = f\"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\".replace('i', str(count))\n```\n\n**Should become:**\n```python\noutput = f\"the number of odd elements {count}n the str{count}ng {count} of the {count}nput.\"\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- Instead of using `.replace('i', str(count))` which replaces all 'i's indiscriminately, we directly format the string with the count value in the exact positions where 'i' should be replaced\n- This matches the expected pattern where 'i' in \"in\", \"string\", \"i\" (standalone), and \"input\" are replaced, but other letters remain unchanged\n- The template already has the 'i's removed from those specific positions, and we insert the count value directly",
