      "remediation": "Looking at the test failures and the implementation, I can identify several issues:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n### Lines to Change:\n\n1. **Lines 18-27 (negative base handling)**: Remove or simplify this entire block. The logic for negative bases is overly complicated and incorrect.\n\n2. **Lines 29-37 (fractional x handling)**: Remove this entire block. The complex calculation for values between 0 and 1 is incorrect and unnecessary.\n\n3. **Lines 39-43 (main logic)**: Fix the loop condition and add handling for negative x values.\n\n### Specific Fixes:\n\n**Fix 1: Simplify negative base handling (lines 18-27)**\n- Remove the complex while loop\n- For negative n (not -1, 0, or 1), simply check powers iteratively like the positive case\n- The current code doesn't properly handle cases like `is_simple_power(-8, -2)` which should be true (-2^3 = -8)\n\n**Fix 2: Remove fractional handling (lines 29-37)**\n- Delete entirely - the spec says \"n**int=x\" where int is an integer\n- Fractional x values between 0 and 1 would require negative integer powers, which can be checked with the main logic\n\n**Fix 3: Fix main logic (lines 39-43)**\n- Change `while power < abs(x)` to `while abs(power) < abs(x)` to handle negative x\n- Add check for `x == 0` case (should return False for n > 1)\n- The loop should work for both positive and negative x values\n\n**Fix 4: Add missing edge case**\n- Before the main loop, add: `if x == 0: return False` (since n^k = 0 only when n=0, already handled)\n\n### Why This Fixes the Issues:\n\n1. **Negative bases**: The current code doesn't properly iterate through powers of negative bases. A simple iterative approach checking `power == x` works for all cases.\n\n2. **Fractional values**: The spec requires integer exponents only, so we don't need special handling for 0 < x < 1.\n\n3. **Negative x**: Using `abs(power)` in the loop condition ensures we don't stop prematurely when checking negative values.\n\n4. **Zero handling**: x=0 is only a power of n when n=0, which is already handled in the edge cases.",
