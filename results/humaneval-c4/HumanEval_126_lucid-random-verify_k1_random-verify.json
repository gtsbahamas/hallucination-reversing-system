      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem Identified:**\nThe current implementation correctly checks for sorting and counts, but there's a subtle issue with the specification interpretation. Looking at the examples more carefully:\n\n- `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` \u2192 True (each number appears at most twice)\n- `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]` \u2192 False (2 appears three times)\n\nThe specification says \"If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, return False.\" This means:\n- 1 duplicate = 2 occurrences total \u2192 OK\n- More than 1 duplicate = 3+ occurrences \u2192 NOT OK\n\n**However**, the edge case issue is likely with **consecutive duplicates in an already sorted list**. The current code checks `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` which allows equal consecutive values, but we need to ensure we're not just checking counts globally - we need to verify the list is actually sorted (non-decreasing).\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n**Lines to change:** Line 8-9 (the sorting check)\n\n**Current code:**\n```python\nif lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Should be:**\n```python\nif lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n    return False\n```\n\nActually, this part is correct. The real issue is likely an **empty list edge case** or the **len(lst) == 0** case.\n\n**Actual fix needed:**\n\n**Line 2:** Change condition to handle empty lists explicitly\n```python\nif len(lst) == 0:\n    return True\nif len(lst) == 1:\n    return True\n```\n\nOr more concisely, the current `len(lst) <= 1` should already handle this.\n\n**The actual bug:** The implementation looks correct. The edge case is likely that the test expects `[]` (empty list) to return `True`, which it does. \n\n**Most likely issue:** The implementation is actually correct as written. If tests are failing, it may be due to import placement or the Counter not being available in the test environment.\n\n**Fix:** Move the import to the top of the function or module level.",
