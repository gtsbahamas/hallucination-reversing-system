      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and the test failure about incorrect return type, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The function doesn't handle the `List[str]` import and may have edge cases where it returns something unexpected.\n\nHowever, the more likely issue based on \"return type is incorrect\" is that the function might be returning something other than a list of strings in edge cases.\n\n**Specific Issues to Fix**:\n\n1. **Line 1**: Add the missing import statement\n   ```python\n   from typing import List\n   ```\n\n2. **Edge case handling**: The current implementation doesn't explicitly handle empty strings or strings with only spaces. When `paren_string` is empty or contains only spaces, the function returns an empty list `[]`, which is correct, but we should verify this is the expected behavior.\n\n3. **Potential issue**: If the input has malformed parentheses (unbalanced), `current_group` might not be empty at the end, but the function would still return a valid `List[str]`. This seems fine based on the spec which assumes balanced input.\n\n**Most Likely Fix**:\n\nThe issue is that the `from typing import List` import is missing at the top of the implementation. This would cause a `NameError` when the function signature is evaluated, which could be interpreted as a \"return type is incorrect\" error by some testing frameworks.\n\n**Fix**: Add this line at the very beginning of the file:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThis is the most straightforward fix that addresses a \"return type is incorrect\" error, as without the import, the type hint `List[str]` cannot be properly evaluated.",
