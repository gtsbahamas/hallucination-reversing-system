      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure and the specification, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The function doesn't handle the edge case when `n == 0` correctly. Currently it returns `[1]`, but based on the specification that says \"return a list of the first n + 1 numbers\", when `n = 0`, we should return a list with 1 element (the first 0+1 = 1 numbers).\n\nHowever, the real issue is likely that the current implementation returns `[1]` for `n=0`, but the specification shows `tri(0) = 1 + 0/2 = 1` is correct. The problem is the function should handle `n=0` within the main logic, not as a special case that returns early.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-3 (the special case handling)\n\n**The fix**:\n1. Remove the special case `if n == 0: return [1]`\n2. Change the initialization to handle when `n < 2`:\n   - If `n == 0`: initialize `result = [1]` and skip the loop\n   - If `n == 1`: initialize `result = [1, 3]` and skip the loop\n   - If `n >= 2`: initialize `result = [1, 3]` and run the loop\n\n**Specific implementation**:\n```python\ndef tri(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return [1]\n    if n == 1:\n        return [1, 3]\n    \n    result = [1, 3]  # tri(0) and tri(1)\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # ... rest stays the same\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: This ensures that for all values of n (0, 1, or greater), we return the correct list of length n+1 with the proper Tribonacci sequence values. The original code was correct but might have an issue with how it handles n=1 implicitly - making the cases explicit ensures correctness.",
