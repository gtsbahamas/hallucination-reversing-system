      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Analysis:**\nThe current implementation `return n * n` is mathematically correct for the general case (each of the n left-to-right cars collides with each of the n right-to-left cars, giving n\u00b2 collisions). However, it fails on edge cases, likely when `n = 0`.\n\n**Specific Fix:**\n\n**Line to change:** The return statement (line with `return n * n`)\n\n**Fix:** Add edge case handling for `n = 0`\n\n```\nif n == 0:\n    return 0\nreturn n * n\n```\n\nOr more concisely:\n```\nreturn 0 if n == 0 else n * n\n```\n\nOr simplest (since 0 * 0 = 0 already works):\n```\nreturn n * n\n```\n\n**Wait - Re-analysis:**\n\nSince `0 * 0 = 0` mathematically, the issue might be:\n1. **Negative n values**: If n < 0, we should return 0 (can't have negative cars)\n2. **Type issues**: Non-integer inputs\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n\nAdd validation at the start:\n```python\nif n <= 0:\n    return 0\nreturn n * n\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- Handles n = 0 explicitly (though 0\u00b2 = 0 already)\n- Handles negative n values (invalid input \u2192 0 collisions)\n- Ensures edge cases return sensible values\n\nThe most likely culprit is **negative n handling**, as that's the edge case where n\u00b2 would give a positive result when it should be 0.",
