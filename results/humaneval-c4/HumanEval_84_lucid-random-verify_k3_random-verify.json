      "remediation": "Looking at the function specification and implementation, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The function returns a string for all inputs, but when `N = 0`, the digit sum is 0, and `bin(0)[2:]` returns `\"0\"`. However, the test expects a specific format or the specification may have an edge case requirement.\n\nActually, reviewing more carefully: The implementation looks correct for the given examples. The issue is likely that **when N = 0, the function should return \"0\"**, which it does. Let me reconsider...\n\n**Actual Problem:** The test failure message says \"return type is incorrect\" - this suggests the function might need to return something other than a string in certain cases, OR there's an issue with the binary conversion format.\n\n**Most Likely Issue:** The `bin()` function in Python returns strings like `\"0b1100\"`, and `[2:]` correctly strips the `\"0b\"` prefix. The implementation should be correct.\n\n**However**, if tests are failing on return type, the issue might be:\n- The function works correctly but there may be a case where an empty string or different type is returned\n- Edge case: When `N = 0`, `str(0)` = `\"0\"`, digit sum = 0, `bin(0)[2:]` = `\"0\"` \u2713\n\n**The Real Fix:**\nNo changes needed to the logic. The implementation is correct. If tests are truly failing, it's likely a test harness issue, not the code.\n\nBut if I must suggest a defensive fix:\n- **Line to change:** None - the implementation matches the specification\n- **Alternative:** Ensure the return is always a string: `return str(bin(digit_sum)[2:])`\n- **Why:** Guarantees string type, though `bin()[2:]` already returns a string\n\nThe current implementation is correct as written.",
