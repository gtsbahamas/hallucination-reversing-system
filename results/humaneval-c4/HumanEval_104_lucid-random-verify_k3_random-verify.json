However, the most likely edge case issue is that the function doesn't handle empty lists explicitly, though it should work correctly.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the logic: **The function logic is correct for the specification**. The issue must be in how \"even digit\" is interpreted.\n\nWait - reviewing the specification again: \"hasn't any even digit\" means NO even digits at all. The digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 are even.\n\n**The actual bug:** The current implementation is correct! But let me verify the edge case that might be failing:\n\nThe function should handle:\n1. Empty list \u2192 return `[]`\n2. Single element lists\n3. Numbers containing 0 (which is even)\n\n**Most likely issue:** The function doesn't explicitly handle the case where a number is 0 itself, or the edge case validation might be expecting different behavior.\n\nHowever, if tests are failing, the most probable issue is:\n\n**Fix Required:**\n- **No changes needed to the core logic** - it correctly identifies numbers with only odd digits (1,3,5,7,9)\n- The implementation already handles empty lists correctly (returns `[]`)\n- The implementation already handles 0 as an even digit\n\n**If tests are still failing, verify:**\n1. That the test expectations match the specification (numbers with ANY even digit should be excluded)\n2. The function correctly handles all edge cases as written\n\n**Conclusion:** The implementation appears correct as-is. If tests fail, the issue is likely in the test expectations, not the code. The function properly:\n- Checks each digit\n- Excludes numbers with any even digit (0,2,4,6,8)\n- Returns sorted results\n- Handles empty lists\n\nNo code changes recommended unless specific failing test cases are provided.",
