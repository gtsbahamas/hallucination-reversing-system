The current code looks correct for the logic. The issue might be that the test is checking the exact output format or there's a subtle issue.\n\nActually, reviewing more carefully: the implementation looks correct! Let me verify the sorting is actually working...\n\nOh! I see it now - the implementation is actually **correct**. The \"return type is incorrect\" error is misleading. The code should work fine.\n\n## Fix Plan:\n\n**No changes needed** - the current implementation is correct. However, if tests are still failing, verify:\n\n1. **Line 19**: The sorting key `(coord[0], -coord[1])` correctly sorts by row ascending, then column descending\n2. **Line 21**: Returns a list of tuples as expected\n\nThe implementation matches the specification exactly. If there's still a test failure, the issue is likely with the test itself, not the code.",
