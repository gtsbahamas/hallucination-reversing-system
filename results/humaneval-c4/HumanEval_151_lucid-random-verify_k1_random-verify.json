      "remediation": "Looking at the specification and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The condition `num > 0` is too restrictive. The specification says to \"ignore numbers that are negative,\" which means we should accept **zero and positive numbers**, not just positive numbers. Zero is neither positive nor negative.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 16\n```python\nif num > 0 and int(num) % 2 == 1:\n```\n\n**Fix**: Change to:\n```python\nif num >= 0 and int(num) % 2 == 1:\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**:\n- The current code excludes 0, but 0 is not negative, so it should be processed\n- 0 is even, so `0 % 2 == 1` is False, meaning it won't contribute to the sum (correct behavior)\n- The test case `double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10` expects 0 to be processed (though it contributes 0 to the sum)\n- By using `>= 0` instead of `> 0`, we properly handle all non-negative numbers including zero\n\nThis aligns with the specification's intent: only ignore **negative** numbers, not zero.",
