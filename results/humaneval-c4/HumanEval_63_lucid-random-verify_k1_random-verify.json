      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and the test failure, I need to trace through the logic:\n\n**Issue Analysis:**\n\nThe iterative approach has an off-by-one error in the loop range. Let me trace through `fibfib(3)`:\n\n- Initial: `a=0, b=0, c=1` (representing fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2))\n- Loop iteration i=3: `a, b, c = 0, 1, 0+0+1 = 0, 1, 1`\n- Returns `c = 1`\n\nBut fibfib(3) should be: fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 \u2713\n\nLet me check `fibfib(4)`:\n- Initial: `a=0, b=0, c=1`\n- i=3: `a, b, c = 0, 1, 1`\n- i=4: `a, b, c = 1, 1, 0+1+1 = 1, 1, 2`\n- Returns `c = 2`\n\nfibfib(4) should be: fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \u2713\n\nActually, the logic seems correct. The \"return type is incorrect\" error suggests the function might be returning something other than an integer in some cases. However, looking at the code, it always returns an integer.\n\n**Wait - I see it now!** The issue is that for n < 3, we return correctly, but the loop `range(3, n + 1)` when n=2 produces an empty range, so we still return `c=1` which is correct. But the error message suggests a type issue...\n\nActually, re-reading: the code looks correct. But \"return type is incorrect\" might mean wrong VALUE (misleading error message). Let me verify the algorithm is actually correct by checking if the initial values and update are right.\n\n**Fix Plan:**\n\nThe code is actually correct! However, if there's truly a test failure, it might be an edge case. The most likely issue is that the problem expects the function to handle edge cases or the test is checking something specific.\n\nBut given the error \"return type is incorrect\", this is likely a value error. The implementation is correct, so no changes needed. \n\n**However**, if I must provide a fix, the only potential improvement would be to make the base cases more explicit or ensure integer return:\n\n- **No changes needed** - the implementation correctly computes the FibFib sequence\n- All return statements return integers\n- The iterative logic correctly maintains the last three values and computes the sum\n\nThe implementation is correct as-is.",
