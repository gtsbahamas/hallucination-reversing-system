      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The function works correctly for the given logic, but the \"return type is incorrect\" error suggests the function might be returning something other than a tuple in edge cases, or there's an issue with how the values are being computed.\n\nHowever, reviewing the code more carefully, the implementation actually looks correct for the specification. The most likely issue is:\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 13-14 (the list comprehensions)\n\n**The fix**: \n- Line 13: Change `[x for x in lst if x < 0]` to `[x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x < 0]`\n- Line 14: Change `[x for x in lst if x > 0]` to `[x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x > 0]`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**:\nThe specification says \"negative integers\" and \"positive integers\" - the current implementation doesn't verify that the values are actually integers. If the list contains floats (e.g., `[-1.5, 2.5]`), they would be included in the filtering, which violates the spec. Adding `isinstance(x, int)` ensures only integer types are considered, which would make the return type behavior consistent with the specification's intent.\n\n**Alternative consideration**: If the test is actually passing non-integer types and expecting them to be filtered out, this would explain why the \"return type is incorrect\" - the function might be returning float values when integers are expected.",
