However, let me verify the logic:\n\n1. **Indices divisible by 3**: 0, 3, 6, 9, ... (i.e., `i % 3 == 0`)\n2. **Test case verification**: `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`\n   - Indices divisible by 3: positions 0, 3, 6 \u2192 values [5, 4, 2]\n   - Sorted: [2, 4, 5]\n   - Expected output: `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`\n   - Position 0: 2 \u2713\n   - Position 3: 4 \u2713\n   - Position 6: 5 \u2713\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe current implementation is **correct** and matches the specification. No changes are needed.\n\n**If feedback indicates a failure**, the most likely issue would be:\n- Misunderstanding of \"divisible by three\" (should be `i % 3 == 0`, which includes index 0)\n- The current implementation correctly handles this\n\n**No fix required** - the implementation properly:\n1. Extracts elements at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, ... using `range(0, len(l), 3)`\n2. Sorts them\n3. Places them back at the same indices\n4. Preserves all other elements unchanged",
