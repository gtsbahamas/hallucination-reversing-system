      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The function returns `x` for `n = 1`, but 1 is not a prime number, so it should return `y`.\n\n**Lines to change:** Line 11 (the condition `if n < 2:`)\n\n**The fix:**\n- Change `if n < 2:` to `if n <= 1:` or keep it as `if n < 2:` (both work the same)\n- The current logic is actually **correct** - it already returns `y` for `n < 2` (which includes `n = 1`)\n\n**Wait, let me reconsider...**\n\nActually, the current implementation looks correct. Let me trace through:\n- For `n = 1`: Returns `y` \u2713 (1 is not prime)\n- For `n = 2`: Skips the loop, returns `x` \u2713 (2 is prime)\n- For `n = 7`: Loop checks 2,3,4,5,6, no divisors found, returns `x` \u2713 (7 is prime)\n- For `n = 15`: Loop finds 15 % 3 == 0, returns `y` \u2713 (15 is not prime)\n\n**Actual issue:** The loop range should be `range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)` but for `n = 4`, this gives `range(2, 3)` which only checks `i = 2`, correctly identifying 4 as composite.\n\nThe implementation appears correct. The test failure might be due to:\n- Edge case with `n = 2`: The loop `range(2, 2)` is empty, so it returns `x` \u2713 (correct, 2 is prime)\n\n**The code is actually correct as written.** If tests are failing, the issue may be with the test cases themselves or there's a misunderstanding of the specification.",
