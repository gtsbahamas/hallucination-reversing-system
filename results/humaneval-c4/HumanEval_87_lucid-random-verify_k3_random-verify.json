Let me verify against the example:\n\nFor `get_row([[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], 1)`:\n- Row 0: finds 1 at column 0 \u2192 (0, 0)\n- Row 1: finds 1 at columns 0 and 4 \u2192 (1, 0), (1, 4)\n- Row 2: finds 1 at columns 0 and 5 \u2192 (2, 0), (2, 5)\n\nAfter sorting by (row ascending, column descending):\n- (0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0) \u2713\n\nHowever, the \"edge case handling\" failure suggests there might be an issue with:\n\n**Potential Issue:** The function doesn't handle `None` or non-list inputs gracefully.\n\n**Lines to change:** Add input validation at the beginning (after line 17, before the result initialization)\n\n**The fix:**\n```python\n# Add after docstring, before result = []\nif not lst or not isinstance(lst, list):\n    return []\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- Handles `None` input\n- Handles non-list inputs\n- Ensures the function doesn't crash on edge cases like `get_row(None, 1)` or `get_row(\"string\", 1)`\n- Empty list `[]` already works correctly, but this makes it more explicit\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If the test expects different behavior for nested non-list elements, add:\n```python\nfor row in lst:\n    if not isinstance(row, list):\n        continue  # Skip non-list rows\n```\n\nThe core logic is correct; the issue is likely missing defensive programming for unexpected inputs.",
