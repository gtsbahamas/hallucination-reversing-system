But if the test is failing on \"return type,\" it's likely testing edge cases like:\n- When one or both lists are empty\n- When there are no common elements\n\n**Fix:**\n\nThe current implementation `return sorted(list(set(l1) & set(l2)))` is actually correct and should work for all cases including empty lists.\n\n**Most likely issue:** The test might be checking that the function explicitly handles empty input or expects consistent behavior. The implementation should already return `[]` for empty inputs or no common elements.\n\n**If the test is truly failing, the fix would be:**\n\nNo changes needed to the logic. The implementation is correct. \n\n**Alternative interpretation:** If \"return type incorrect\" means the test expects a specific container type in edge cases, ensure we're always returning a list:\n\n```python\ndef common(l1: list, l2: list):\n    ret = set(l1) & set(l2)\n    return sorted(list(ret))\n```\n\nThis is functionally identical but makes the conversion explicit. The current implementation should already pass all tests based on the specification provided.",
