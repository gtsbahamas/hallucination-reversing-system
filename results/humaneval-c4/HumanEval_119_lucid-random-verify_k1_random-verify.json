Let me reconsider the error message \"return type is incorrect.\"\n\n**Actual Issue**: The return statements are correct. The implementation looks sound. But if tests are failing on return type, it might be expecting different capitalization or the test framework issue.\n\nActually, reviewing once more - the code IS correct as written. The `is_balanced` function properly:\n1. Tracks open/close parentheses count\n2. Returns False if count goes negative (more closes than opens at any point)\n3. Returns True only if count ends at 0 (equal opens and closes)\n\n**Most Likely Issue**: If the error says \"return type is incorrect\", but the code returns strings `'Yes'` and `'No'` as specified, then the implementation is actually **correct** and there may be:\n- A test harness issue\n- Or the error message is misleading\n\n**No fix needed** - the implementation correctly solves the problem as specified. The function properly checks both concatenation orders and returns the correct string values.\n\nIf forced to suggest something: Verify the test expects `'Yes'/'No'` and not `True/False` or `'YES'/'NO'`, but based on the examples provided, the current implementation is correct.",
