      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure \"The return type is incorrect for some inputs,\" I need to analyze what could cause a type mismatch.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The `sum_of_digits` function returns an integer from `sum()`, but there might be an edge case where it doesn't return the expected type.\n\n**Lines to change:** Line 11 (the `sum_of_digits` function)\n\n**The fix:**\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n1. **Negative numbers**: If the list contains negative numbers, `str(n)` would include a '-' sign, which would cause `int(digit)` to fail when trying to convert '-' to an integer.\n2. Using `abs(n)` ensures we only process the digits, not the sign.\n3. However, since `is_prime(n)` already filters out negative numbers (returns False for n < 2), this is unlikely the issue.\n\n**More likely issue:** The actual problem is that the function might return `0` when no primes are found, but the specification doesn't clarify what should happen in this case. However, looking more carefully:\n\n**Alternative fix (more likely):**\nThe issue is probably that `sum()` on an empty generator could theoretically cause issues, though it should return 0. The real issue might be ensuring the return value is explicitly an `int` type.\n\n**Recommended change:** Line 11\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    return int(sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n)))\n```\n\nThis ensures the return type is always `int`, not potentially a numpy int or other numeric type if the input list contains such types.",
