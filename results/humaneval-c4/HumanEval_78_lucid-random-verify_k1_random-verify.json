      "remediation": "Looking at the function specification and implementation, I need to analyze what could cause a \"return type is incorrect\" error.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation:\n1. Correctly identifies prime hex digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), D (13)\n2. Iterates through the string and counts matches\n3. Returns an integer count\n\nThe logic appears sound, but the error message suggests a type issue. Let me trace through the examples:\n- \"AB\" \u2192 should return 1 (only B is prime) \u2713\n- \"1077E\" \u2192 should return 2 (two 7s) \u2713\n- \"ABED1A33\" \u2192 should return 4 (B, D, 3, 3) \u2713\n\nWait - the implementation looks correct for the logic. The \"return type is incorrect\" error is puzzling since it always returns an `int`.\n\n## The Issue\n\nThe most likely problem: **The function might receive `None` or non-string input in edge cases**, and the current implementation would fail or behave unexpectedly.\n\nHowever, re-reading more carefully: the specification says \"you may assume the input is always correct or **empty string**\". For an empty string, the function correctly returns `0`.\n\nActually, the implementation is correct! But if the test system expects a specific behavior that's not in the spec, or if there's a subtle issue...\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Most likely issue**: None. The implementation is correct as-is.\n\n**If there IS an issue**, it would be:\n- **Line to change**: None needed, but add defensive check at the start\n- **Add after line 1 (function definition)**:\n  ```python\n  if not num or not isinstance(num, str):\n      return 0\n  ```\n- **Why**: Handles edge cases where input might be None or non-string type\n\n**Alternative**: The test might be checking for a different return in some edge case not covered in the spec. Without seeing the actual failing test case, the current implementation appears correct per specification.",
