      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test results, let me analyze the issue:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation correctly:\n1. Tracks opening brackets by incrementing `count`\n2. Tracks closing brackets by decrementing `count`\n3. Returns `False` immediately if we encounter more closing brackets than opening ones (count < 0)\n4. Returns `True` only if count equals 0 at the end\n\nThis logic appears sound for the specification. Let me verify against the examples:\n- `\"(\"` \u2192 count=1, returns `False` \u2713\n- `\"()\"` \u2192 count=0, returns `True` \u2713\n- `\"(()())\"` \u2192 count=0, returns `True` \u2713\n- `\")(()\"` \u2192 count goes negative immediately, returns `False` \u2713\n\n## The Issue\n\nThe error message \"The return type is incorrect for some inputs\" suggests the function might be returning something other than a boolean in edge cases. However, the current implementation always returns a boolean.\n\n**Wait** - I need to reconsider. Looking more carefully at the logic flow:\n\nThe function has `return count == 0` at the end, which correctly returns a boolean. The early return `return False` is also boolean.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nActually, the implementation looks correct! But if tests are failing with \"incorrect return type,\" the most likely issue is:\n\n**No fix needed for logic** - the implementation is correct.\n\nHowever, if there's truly a test failure, it might be due to:\n- Edge case: empty string `\"\"` \u2192 count=0, returns `True` (which is correct - no unmatched brackets)\n\nThe implementation is actually **correct as written**. If tests are genuinely failing, the issue may be with the test suite itself, not the function.\n\nIf forced to suggest a change: None needed. The function correctly implements the specification and handles all cases including edge cases.",
