      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and the test failure, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The function signature specifies `List[int]` as the return type, but the implementation doesn't handle cases where the input list might contain non-integer types or where type consistency needs to be maintained.\n\nHowever, the more likely issue is that the implementation is actually **correct for the given specification**, but the test might be checking edge cases. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, reviewing the code more carefully: **The implementation is functionally correct** for the given specification. The issue \"return type is incorrect for some inputs\" suggests the test is passing inputs that aren't `List[int]`.\n\n## Most Likely Fix:\n\n**Lines to change:** None in the core logic, but add type validation\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Add input validation at the start to ensure we're working with integers\n2. Or, handle the case where `numbers` might contain `float` values that should be converted\n\n**Specific change needed:**\n\nIf the test is passing floats or mixed types:\n- After line 2 (`return []`), we need to ensure type consistency\n- The function should either:\n  - Cast values to int: `current_max = int(numbers[0])`\n  - Or handle numeric types more broadly\n\n**Most likely fix (lines 4-5):**\n```python\nresult = []\ncurrent_max = int(numbers[0]) if numbers else None\n```\n\nAnd in the loop (line 7):\n```python\ncurrent_max = max(current_max, int(num))\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:** Ensures the return type is strictly `List[int]` even if the input contains floats or other numeric types, maintaining type consistency with the declared return type.",
