      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Identified:**\nThe triangle validity check uses `<=` (less than or equal to) when it should use `<` (strictly less than). The specification states \"the sum of any two sides is **greater than** the third side,\" which means equality should make the triangle invalid. However, the current code returns -1 when the sum equals the third side, which is actually correct for a degenerate triangle. The real issue is likely with the edge case where sides could be zero or negative.\n\n**Lines to Change:**\n\n**Line 11:** Add validation for non-positive side lengths\n```python\n# Add before the triangle inequality check:\nif a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:\n    return -1\n```\n\n**Why This Fixes the Issue:**\n1. The current implementation doesn't handle invalid inputs like zero or negative side lengths\n2. These would pass the triangle inequality check in some cases (e.g., `a=0, b=1, c=1` would fail `a + b <= c` as `1 <= 1` is True, but this is coincidental)\n3. More critically, cases like `a=-1, b=5, c=5` could pass the inequality checks but represent invalid triangles\n4. Heron's formula would also produce incorrect results (potentially complex numbers or wrong values) with non-positive inputs\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If the edge case is specifically about the `<=` vs `<` distinction, the triangle inequality check is actually correct as-is (degenerate triangles with sum equal to the third side should return -1). The issue is most likely missing input validation.",
