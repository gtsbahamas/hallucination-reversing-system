      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Analysis:**\nThe specification is misleading. It says \"returns an array of the **first n integers** that are prime numbers **and less than n**\" which is contradictory. However, the examples clearly show the function should return **all prime numbers less than n** (not the first n primes).\n\nThe current implementation is actually **correct** based on the examples provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**No fix needed.** The implementation correctly:\n1. Returns all prime numbers less than n\n2. Handles edge cases (n \u2264 2 returns empty list)\n3. Uses proper primality testing (checking divisibility up to \u221anum)\n4. Matches all test cases in the specification\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe docstring should be clarified to say: \"returns an array of all prime numbers less than n\" instead of \"the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\"\n\nIf the specification truly meant \"first n primes\" (regardless of their value), then the implementation would need significant changes, but the examples contradict this interpretation.",
