      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The function returns `(even_count, odd_count)` but the specification expects `(even_count, odd_count)` - wait, let me check the examples more carefully.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n- `even_odd_count(-12)` should return `(1, 1)` - digits are 1 (odd) and 2 (even), so 1 even, 1 odd \u2713\n- `even_odd_count(123)` should return `(1, 2)` - digits are 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), so 1 even, 2 odd \u2713\n\nThe logic appears correct. However, the test says \"return type is incorrect for some inputs.\"\n\n**Root Cause**: The issue is likely with edge case `num = 0`. When `num = 0`, `str(abs(0))` gives `\"0\"`, which is a single even digit. The function would return `(1, 0)`, which is correct. But if the test expects a different behavior or there's a type issue...\n\nActually, re-reading: \"return type is incorrect\" suggests the function might not always return a tuple. But it always does.\n\n**Most Likely Issue**: The function returns a tuple, but perhaps for some edge case it should handle differently, OR there's an issue with how we're counting.\n\n**Actual Fix Needed**:\nNo changes needed to lines - the implementation is correct. However, if tests are failing, verify:\n1. The function always returns a tuple (it does)\n2. Edge cases like `0` are handled (they are - returns `(1, 0)`)\n\nThe current implementation is correct per the specification. If tests fail, the test expectations may be wrong, or there's a misunderstanding of the spec.",
