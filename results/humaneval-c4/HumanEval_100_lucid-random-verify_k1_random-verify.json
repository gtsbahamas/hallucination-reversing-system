      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Analysis:**\nThe current implementation correctly handles the main logic (incrementing by 2 to maintain odd/even sequence), but there's likely an issue with how it handles the initial value or the sequence generation.\n\nLooking at the specification more carefully:\n- \"The number of stones in the next level is: the next odd number if n is odd, the next even number if n is even\"\n- This means if n is odd, ALL levels should have odd numbers\n- If n is even, ALL levels should have even numbers\n\nThe current implementation already does this correctly by starting with `n` and adding 2 each time.\n\n**However, the edge case issue is likely:**\nThe function doesn't validate that `n` is a positive integer. If `n <= 0`, it would return an empty list, which may not be the intended behavior for edge cases.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n**Line to change:** Add validation at the beginning of the function (after line 13, before line 14)\n\n**The fix:**\n```python\nif n <= 0:\n    return []  # or raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- Explicitly handles edge cases where n is 0 or negative\n- Returns an empty list for invalid input (or raises an error if stricter validation is needed)\n- Prevents unexpected behavior with non-positive integers\n\n**Alternative consideration:**\nIf the test expects a different behavior for n=0 or n=1, the fix might need adjustment, but the current logic for n >= 1 appears correct based on the specification.",
