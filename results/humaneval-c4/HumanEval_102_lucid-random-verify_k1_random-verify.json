If `y` is even, return `y`\n2. If `y` is odd, check if `y - 1` (which is even) is in range `[x, y]`\n3. If `y - 1 < x`, there's no even number in range\n\nThe current implementation is actually correct for this logic. The bug must be elsewhere.\n\n**Real Fix Plan:**\n\nThe condition `y - 1 >= x` should also verify that `y - 1` is even (which it always is when `y` is odd), but the issue is when `y` is odd and equals `x`, then `y - 1 < x`, correctly returning -1.\n\nWait - if `y` is odd and `y - 1 >= x`, then `y - 1` is guaranteed to be even. The implementation looks correct.\n\n**The actual bug:** When `y` is odd and `y - 1 < x`, we need to return -1, which the else clause handles. This seems correct too.\n\nLet me check: if `x = y` and both are odd, then `y - 1 < x`, so it returns -1. \u2713\n\nThe implementation appears logically sound. The test failure might be due to a different edge case not covered in the examples.",
