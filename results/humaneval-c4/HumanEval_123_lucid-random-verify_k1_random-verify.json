      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test failure, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The function doesn't handle the edge case where `n = 1`. When `n = 1`, the while loop condition `while current != 1` is false from the start, so the loop never executes. The function then only appends 1 to the list and returns `[1]`, which is correct. However, let me trace through another case...\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. The logic seems correct for `n = 1`. Let me trace `n = 5`:\n- Start: current = 5, odd_numbers = []\n- Iteration 1: 5 is odd \u2192 append 5, current = 16\n- Iteration 2: 16 is even \u2192 current = 8\n- Iteration 3: 8 is even \u2192 current = 4\n- Iteration 4: 4 is even \u2192 current = 2\n- Iteration 5: 2 is even \u2192 current = 1\n- Exit loop, append 1\n- Result: [5, 1] \u2192 sorted: [1, 5] \u2713\n\nThe issue is likely that **the function returns a list when it should handle some edge case differently**, or there's a subtle bug. Let me check more carefully...\n\n**Actual Problem**: The return type error suggests the function might be returning something other than a list in some cases. However, the code always returns `sorted(odd_numbers)` which is always a list.\n\n**Most Likely Issue**: The function is correct! But if tests are failing on \"return type\", it might be that the test expects the function to handle invalid inputs (like `n <= 0`) differently, or there's an infinite loop case.\n\n## Concrete Fix\n\n**Lines to change**: Add input validation at the beginning (after line 2 of the function body)\n\n**The fix**:\n```python\nif n <= 0:\n    return []  # or raise ValueError\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: If the test is passing negative numbers or zero, the current code would enter an infinite loop (for even negatives) or incorrect behavior. Adding validation ensures proper handling of edge cases.\n\n**Alternative if that's not it**: The code is actually correct as-is for valid positive integers. The test failure might be a false positive or testing framework issue.",
