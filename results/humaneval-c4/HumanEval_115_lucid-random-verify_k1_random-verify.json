      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test results, I can see the function is marked as correct. However, let me verify the logic carefully:\n\nThe current implementation:\n```python\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    total_trips = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        water_units = sum(row)\n        trips_needed = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)\n        total_trips += trips_needed\n    return total_trips\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The logic correctly counts water units per row (well)\n- Uses `math.ceil()` to round up the division\n- Sums all trips across all wells\n\n**Potential Issue:**\nThe only edge case that could cause problems is when `water_units = 0`. In this case:\n- `math.ceil(0 / capacity)` = `math.ceil(0.0)` = `0` \u2713\n\nThis is correct behavior.\n\n**Fix Plan:**\n\n**No fix needed.** The implementation is correct as-is. It properly:\n1. Iterates through each well (row)\n2. Counts water units using `sum(row)`\n3. Calculates trips needed using ceiling division\n4. Accumulates the total\n\nIf there's feedback indicating an issue, it might be:\n- A misunderstanding of the problem\n- An issue with test harness/environment\n- The function signature (should be `capacity` not `bucket_capacity` in parameter name - but the spec shows `capacity` which matches)\n\nThe current implementation correctly handles all three examples and edge cases.",
