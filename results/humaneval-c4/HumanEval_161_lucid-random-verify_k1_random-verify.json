      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Analysis:**\nThe implementation logic appears correct for the main cases. The bug is likely in how it handles the \"no letters\" condition. The current code checks `any(c.isalpha() for c in s)` which works for most cases, but may fail on edge cases like:\n- Empty string `\"\"`\n- Strings with only non-letter characters\n\n**Lines to Change:**\n\n**Line 2:** `has_letter = any(c.isalpha() for c in s)`\n\n**Fix:**\n```python\nhas_letter = any(c.isalpha() for c in s) if s else False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- For empty string `\"\"`, `any()` on an empty iterator returns `False`, which is correct\n- However, the explicit check `if s else False` makes the intent clearer and handles the edge case more robustly\n- Actually, the current code should handle empty strings correctly already\n\n**Alternative Issue - Line 4:** `return s[::-1]`\n\nThe more likely issue: The condition might need to be more explicit about when to reverse. If `s` is empty, `s[::-1]` returns `\"\"` which is correct.\n\n**Most Likely Fix:**\nThe implementation is actually correct as-is. The issue might be in test interpretation. However, if there's a bug, it's most likely that the function needs to handle the empty string case explicitly:\n\n**Add after line 2:**\n```python\nif not s:\n    return s\n```\n\n**Why:** Explicitly handles empty string before checking for letters, ensuring consistent behavior for this edge case.",
