Hmm, let me verify if 13441 is actually prime.\n\nActually, the issue is likely with **n = 2 or n = 3** edge cases, or there's a subtle bug in the range.\n\nLooking more carefully: The implementation looks correct for standard cases. The \"edge case\" issue might be:\n\n## Fix Plan:\n\n**No fix needed** - the implementation is actually correct. However, if the test is failing, verify:\n\n1. **Line 11** (`if n < 2`): This correctly handles n=1 and negative numbers\n2. **Line 13** (`if n == 2`): This correctly identifies 2 as prime\n3. **Line 15** (`if n % 2 == 0`): This correctly eliminates even numbers\n4. **Line 17** (`range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2)`): This correctly checks odd divisors up to \u221an\n\nThe implementation follows the standard trial division algorithm correctly. If tests are failing, the issue is likely:\n- The test case `is_prime(13441)` might be incorrect (13441 may not actually be prime)\n- Or there's a floating-point precision issue with `n**0.5`\n\n**Potential fix** (if floating-point is the issue):\n- **Line 17**: Change `int(n**0.5)` to `int(n**0.5) + 1` to ensure we don't miss the exact square root due to floating-point errors.\n\nBut the current `+ 1` is already there, so the implementation should be correct as-is.",
