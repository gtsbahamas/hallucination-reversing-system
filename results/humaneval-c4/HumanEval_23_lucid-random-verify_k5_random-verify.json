However, since it's failing edge case tests, the likely issues are:\n\n1. **Non-string input handling** - Function may receive `None` or non-string types\n2. **Special characters** - Unicode, emojis, or multi-byte characters (though Python handles these correctly by default)\n3. **Performance/style** - Using manual counting instead of built-in `len()`\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n\n**Line 10-12: Replace manual counting with built-in `len()`**\n```python\nreturn len(string)\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- Python's built-in `len()` is the standard, tested way to get string length\n- Handles all edge cases correctly (empty strings, Unicode, special characters)\n- More efficient and Pythonic\n- The manual loop implementation is unnecessary and error-prone\n\n**Alternative (if type safety is the issue):**\nAdd input validation before line 10:\n```python\nif not isinstance(string, str):\n    raise TypeError(\"Input must be a string\")\n```\n\n**Most likely fix:** Simply replace lines 10-12 with `return len(string)` - the manual counting loop is the anti-pattern causing the failure.",
