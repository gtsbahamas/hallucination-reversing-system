The actual issue might be:\n\n**Alternative Issue:**\nThe function might be expected to return `[0]` for a constant polynomial instead of `[]`.\n\n**Revised Fix Plan:**\n\n**Lines to Change:**\nLines 10-11\n\n**The Fix:**\nChange from:\n```python\nif len(xs) <= 1:\n    return []\n```\n\nTo:\n```python\nif len(xs) == 0:\n    return []\nif len(xs) == 1:\n    return [0]\n```\n\n**Why This Fixes It:**\n- For empty polynomial: derivative is empty `[]`\n- For constant polynomial (e.g., `[5]`): derivative is zero, represented as `[0]`\n- This matches mathematical convention where the derivative of a constant is 0, not an empty polynomial",
