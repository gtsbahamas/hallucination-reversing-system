Let me verify with the examples:\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` should return `False` \u2713 (4 < 8)\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` should return `False` \u2713 (6 < 8)\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` should return `True` \u2713 (8 \u2265 8 and even)\n\nThe logic seems correct for these cases. But the test says \"return type is incorrect for some inputs.\"\n\n## The Issue\n\nThe problem is likely with **odd numbers**. The current implementation returns `False` for odd numbers (due to `n % 2 == 0`), which is correct. But there might be an edge case or the function might not be handling non-integer inputs properly.\n\nActually, re-reading: the return type should always be boolean, which it is. The issue must be that the function returns the wrong **boolean value** for some inputs.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No changes needed to the logic itself** - the implementation is mathematically correct:\n- Any even number \u2265 8 CAN be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers\n- Any number < 8 or odd number CANNOT\n\nThe current implementation `return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0` is correct.\n\n**However**, if the test is failing, it might be expecting explicit `True`/`False` returns or there's a type coercion issue. The fix would be:\n\n**Line to change:** Line with the return statement\n\n**Fix:** Ensure explicit boolean return by wrapping in `bool()`:\n```python\nreturn bool(n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0)\n```\n\n**Why:** This ensures the return value is explicitly a boolean type, avoiding any potential type coercion issues with the comparison operators.",
