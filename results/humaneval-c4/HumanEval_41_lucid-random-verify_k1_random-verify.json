Here's why:\n\n**Analysis:**\n- There are `n` cars moving left-to-right (L\u2192R)\n- There are `n` cars moving right-to-left (R\u2192L)\n- All cars move at the same speed\n- Cars pass through each other after collision\n\n**Logic:**\nSince the two sets start far apart and move toward each other at the same speed, every L\u2192R car will eventually meet and collide with every R\u2192L car exactly once. The cars continue moving after collision, so they don't block subsequent collisions.\n\n**Result:**\n- Each of the `n` L\u2192R cars collides with each of the `n` R\u2192L cars\n- Total collisions = `n \u00d7 n = n\u00b2`\n\nThe function correctly returns `n * n`, which matches the specification. The test results confirm this is working as expected.",
