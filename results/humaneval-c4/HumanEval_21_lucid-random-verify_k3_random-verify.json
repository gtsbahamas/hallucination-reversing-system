      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: When all numbers in the list are identical (e.g., `[5.0, 5.0, 5.0]`), the function returns `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, but the specification states \"the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1\". When min equals max, both conditions should be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 11-12 (the edge case handling)\n\n**The fix**:\n```python\nif range_val == 0:\n    return [0.5] * len(numbers)  # or could be [0.0] * len(numbers) depending on interpretation\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: \n- When all numbers are identical, they are simultaneously both the minimum and maximum\n- Returning `0.5` represents a midpoint between 0 and 1, satisfying both constraints in a balanced way\n- Alternatively, returning `[0.0]` could work if we interpret identical values as satisfying the \"minimum becomes 0\" constraint with priority\n- The most mathematically sound approach might be to return `[0.0]` since the transform `(x - min) / (max - min)` is indeterminate (0/0) when min=max, and the limit as the range approaches 0 would be 0\n\n**Most likely intended fix**: Keep `[0.0] * len(numbers)` but the test might expect a different behavior. Check if the test expects the function to handle this edge case differently, or if \"at least two elements\" implies they must be distinct values.",

Applies the linear transformation: `(x - min) / range` to each element\n\nThis correctly maps:\n- The minimum value to 0: `(min - min) / range = 0`\n- The maximum value to 1: `(max - min) / range = 1`\n- All other values proportionally between 0 and 1\n\nThe test results confirm the implementation is working as expected.",
