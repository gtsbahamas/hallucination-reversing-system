      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** The function logic is actually correct. The issue is likely that the function is missing an explicit return type annotation, or there's a mismatch between what's expected and what's returned.\n\nHowever, analyzing the code more carefully with the test feedback \"return type is incorrect for some inputs,\" the actual implementation appears logically sound. Let me reconsider...\n\n**Actual Issue:** The code logic is correct, but given the feedback about return type, the most likely issue is:\n\n**No changes needed to the logic.** The implementation correctly:\n1. Tracks depth with a counter\n2. Increments for `<`\n3. Decrements for `>`\n4. Returns `False` if depth goes negative (closing bracket without opening)\n5. Returns `True` only if depth is exactly 0 at the end\n\n**Verification:**\n- `correct_bracketing(\"<\")` \u2192 depth=1, returns `False` \u2713\n- `correct_bracketing(\"<>\")` \u2192 depth=0, returns `True` \u2713\n- `correct_bracketing(\"<<><>>\")` \u2192 depth=0, returns `True` \u2713\n- `correct_bracketing(\"><<>\")` \u2192 depth=-1 immediately, returns `False` \u2713\n\n**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct as-is. If tests are failing with \"return type is incorrect,\" the issue may be:\n1. The test harness expects a different return type (unlikely given bool is standard)\n2. There's an edge case with empty string (should return `True`)\n3. The function needs explicit type hints: `-> bool`\n\n**Recommended fix:** Add explicit return type annotation:\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n```\n\nThis is the only change needed - the logic is already correct.",
