      "remediation": "Looking at the function specification and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The function returns `True` when `txt` is a single alphabetical character (e.g., `\"a\"`), but according to the specification, a single letter IS a word (not separated by space), so it should return `False`.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 18-19\n\n**Current code:**\n```python\nif len(txt) == 1:\n    return True\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```python\nif len(txt) == 1:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \n- The specification states the character must \"not be a part of a word\"\n- A \"word\" is defined as \"a group of characters separated by space\"\n- A single character with no spaces is still a word (just a one-character word)\n- For a character to NOT be part of a word, it must be isolated by spaces\n- Examples confirm this: `\"apple pi e\"` returns `True` because `'e'` is preceded by a space (isolated), while `\"apple pie\"` returns `False` because `'e'` is part of the word \"pie\"\n- A single character like `\"a\"` has no space before it, so it's a complete word by itself, thus should return `False`",
