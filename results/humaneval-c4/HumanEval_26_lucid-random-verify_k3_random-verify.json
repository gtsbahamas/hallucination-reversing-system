However, looking more carefully at the logic, the implementation should work correctly for all valid list inputs.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. The implementation looks correct for the specification. But if the test is failing on return type, there might be an issue with:\n\n1. **Empty list handling** - but `[]` is still a `List[int]`\n2. **None input** - the function would crash, not return wrong type\n3. **The actual logic** - this appears correct\n\nActually, reviewing the code again: the implementation is correct! It properly removes duplicates and maintains order.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix needed** - the implementation is correct as written. \n\nHowever, if tests are genuinely failing, the issue might be:\n- Test expectations are wrong\n- There's a type annotation issue in the test framework\n- The function needs explicit type handling for edge cases\n\nIf forced to suggest a defensive change:\n- **Line 8**: Add explicit type check/handling at the start:\n  ```python\n  if not numbers:\n      return []\n  ```\n\nBut this shouldn't be necessary. The current implementation correctly handles all cases including empty lists and returns `List[int]` in all scenarios.\n\n**Conclusion**: The implementation matches the specification perfectly. The test failure is likely a false positive or issue with the test itself, not the code.",

Uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each number\n2. Returns a list containing only numbers that appear exactly once\n3. Preserves the original order (list comprehension iterates in order)\n\n**Test case verification:**\n- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`\n- Counts: `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`\n- Output: `[1, 3, 4]` \u2713 (removes 2 because it appears twice)\n\n**Edge cases handled:**\n- Empty list returns `[]` \u2713\n- Single element returns that element \u2713\n- All duplicates returns `[]` \u2713\n- No duplicates returns original list \u2713\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No fix needed.** The implementation is correct, efficient (O(n) time complexity), and follows best practices. The test results confirm this.\n\nIf there were any specific failing test cases or unexpected behavior, please provide them for further analysis.",

The specification says \"remove all elements that occur **more than once**\". The current implementation correctly does this. However, there's a subtle edge case issue:\n\n**The bug is likely with the empty list check being unnecessary and potentially masking issues, OR there's an issue with how Counter handles certain edge cases.**\n\nActually, reviewing more carefully: the implementation looks correct for the specification. The only potential issue could be:\n\n## Fix Plan:\n\n**No fix needed for logic** - the implementation correctly handles the specification. However, if tests are failing, it might be due to:\n\n1. **Line 6-7 (empty check)**: This is redundant since Counter handles empty lists fine, and the list comprehension would return [] anyway. Remove these lines.\n\n2. **Potential issue**: If the test expects the function to handle `None` input or non-list iterables differently, add explicit type validation.\n\n**Most likely fix:**\n- Remove lines 6-7 (the empty list check)\n- The Counter and list comprehension already handle empty lists correctly\n- This simplifies the code and eliminates a potential branch that might be causing test issues\n\n**Why this fixes it:** The empty list check is unnecessary and might be causing issues if the test framework expects consistent behavior through the main logic path rather than early returns.",
