The most likely issue is with **length = 1**, which the current code returns `False` for, but we need to verify if this is the expected behavior based on the mathematical definition.\n\nHowever, the more critical bug is likely in the **primality test logic**. Let me trace through:\n\n## Identified Bug\n**Line 4-5**: The condition `if length < 2: return False` is mathematically correct (1 is not prime), but there might be an edge case with **empty strings** (length = 0) or the test suite might have different expectations.\n\n**More likely issue**: The loop range calculation on **line 11** could have an off-by-one error or the initial checks might be missing a case.\n\nActually, reviewing more carefully: **Line 8-9** checks `if length == 2: return True` which is correct, but this creates a gap in logic flow.\n\n## The Real Bug\nThe issue is that after checking `length < 2` and `length == 2`, when `length % 2 == 0` is checked, we correctly return False for even numbers > 2. However, **the code never explicitly handles length = 1 or length = 0 as special cases that might be expected differently**.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change: 4-5**\n\n**Current:**\n```python\nif length < 2:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```python\nif length <= 1:\n    return False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it:** Makes the edge case handling more explicit. If the test expects length=0 or length=1 to return False (which is mathematically correct since 0 and 1 are not prime), this ensures clarity.\n\n**Alternative fix if tests expect different behavior:**\nIf tests expect empty strings or single-character strings to be handled differently, change to:\n```python\nif length == 0:\n    return False  # or True, depending on spec\nif length == 1:\n    return False  # 1 is not prime\n```\n\nThe current logic is mathematically sound, so the \"edge case\" failure likely means the test suite has a specific expectation about length=0 or length=1 that differs from standard prime definition.",
