      "remediation": "Looking at the implementation and specification, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The current implementation doesn't handle the case where multiple nodes have the same smallest even value. According to the specification, when there are duplicate smallest even values, we should return the one with the **smallest index** (the first occurrence).\n\n**Current Bug**: \nLine 10: `if smallest_even is None or value < smallest_even:`\n\nThis condition only updates when we find a **strictly smaller** value. When we encounter a duplicate of the current smallest even value, we don't update the index, which is correct. However, the logic is actually fine for this requirement.\n\n**Wait - Re-analyzing**: Actually, the current logic IS correct for the duplicate case. Let me reconsider...\n\n**Actual Problem**: The issue is likely with **zero handling**. Zero is even (0 % 2 == 0), and the current implementation should handle it correctly. \n\nAfter reviewing Example 4 more carefully: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]` should return `[0, 1]` (the first zero at index 1).\n\nThe current implementation would:\n- Find 0 at index 1, set smallest_even=0, smallest_index=1\n- Find 0 at index 3, but 0 is not < 0, so don't update\n- Find 4 at index 4, but 4 is not < 0, so don't update  \n- Find 2 at index 5, but 2 is not < 0, so don't update\n- Return [0, 1] \u2713\n\n**The implementation appears correct!** \n\nThe test failure might be due to:\n1. **Input validation** - The function doesn't validate that values are non-negative integers\n2. **Type handling** - No handling for non-integer types in the array\n\n**Fix**: Add input validation at the beginning (lines 2-3):\n- Check if array elements are valid non-negative integers\n- Skip or handle invalid elements appropriately\n\nOr the test might be checking for a different edge case not covered in the examples.",
