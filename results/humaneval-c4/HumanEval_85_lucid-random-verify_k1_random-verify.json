The function should always return an integer (sum), which it does. The test failure suggests the expected behavior might be different.\n\n**Most Likely Fix**:\n\nAfter re-reading the specification \"add the even elements that are at odd indices\", the current implementation is actually correct. The test failure about \"return type\" suggests:\n\n1. **Check if the function should return 0 for empty results** - Current code does this correctly\n2. **The specification example shows `==>` not `==>`** - This is just formatting\n\n**Real Issue**: Given the test says \"return type is incorrect\", the problem might be that:\n- Some test cases expect a different type (float vs int)\n- Or the function needs to handle None/empty list cases\n\n**Concrete Fix**:\n- **Line 9**: No change needed to the logic\n- **Add at line 8** (before the loop): Check if `lst` is None or handle type conversion\n- **Line 12**: Ensure return value is explicitly cast: `return int(total)`\n\n**Most probable fix**: The function is actually correct as-is. The test failure might be a false positive, or there's a mismatch in test expectations. If forced to change, add explicit type casting:\n\n```python\nreturn int(total)  # Line 12\n```\n\nBut the current implementation should work correctly for the given specification.",
