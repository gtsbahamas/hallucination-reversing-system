      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem Identified:**\nThe current implementation has an **off-by-one error** in the length calculation. According to the specification, the intervals are **closed** (include both endpoints), but the length calculation treats them as if measuring distance, not counting elements.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n- `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))`: intersection is `(2, 2)`, which contains 1 element {2}, length should be 1, not 0\n- `intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))`: intersection is `(0, 1)`, which contains 2 elements {0, 1}, length should be 2, not 1  \n- `intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))`: intersection is `(-3, -1)`, which contains 3 elements {-3, -2, -1}, length should be 3, not 2\n\nHowever, the docstring example states: \"intersection of (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3) which its length is 1\"\n- This contains elements {2, 3}, which is 2 elements, but they call it length 1\n- This suggests length = (end - start), not the count of integers\n\n**The Real Issue:**\nRe-examining the test case `intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))`:\n- Intersection: (0, 1), length = 1 - 0 = 1\n- Expected output: \"NO\" (1 is not prime \u2713)\n\nBut `intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))`:\n- Intersection: (-3, -1), length = -1 - (-3) = 2  \n- Expected output: \"YES\" (2 is prime \u2713)\n\n**The implementation is actually correct!** The length formula `end - start` matches all test cases. No fix needed.\n\n**Wait - Let me verify the prime check:**\nThe prime checking logic is correct for numbers \u2265 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The implementation appears correct based on the specification and examples. If there's a failure, it would be in edge cases not covered. Without specific feedback about what's failing, the code logic is sound.",
