      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\nThe error is a **syntax error** caused by including the explanation/comments with special characters (\u2192) in the actual code file. The implementation logic itself is correct.\n\n**Lines to change:**\n- Remove lines 23-30 (the verification comments that start with \"Let me verify...\" through the bullet points with \u2192 characters)\n\n**The fix:**\nDelete the entire comment block that contains:\n```\nLet me verify with the expected output...\n- `-1` \u2192 -1\n- `-11` \u2192 0\n...\n```\n\nThese are explanation notes that accidentally got included in the code file. They contain the Unicode character '\u2192' (U+2192) which Python interprets as invalid syntax.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe SyntaxError occurs because Python is trying to parse the explanation text as code. The arrow character (\u2192) and the backticks are not valid Python syntax. Removing these comment lines will leave only the valid function definition, which will execute correctly.\n\nThe actual implementation logic (lines 1-22 in the conceptual breakdown) is sound and handles:\n- Zero correctly\n- Negative numbers with only the first digit being negative\n- Stable sorting using enumerate and tuple keys",
