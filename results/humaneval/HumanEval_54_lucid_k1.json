      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error is a syntax error caused by non-ASCII characters (\u2192) in the docstring comments that were accidentally included in the actual code file.\n\n**Fix**: Remove the analysis comments from the implementation. These were meant to be part of the reasoning process, not part of the actual code.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines**: Remove all the lines between the docstring and the actual function implementation (the lines starting with \"Looking at the examples...\" through \"The function should check...\")\n- **Keep**: Only the function signature, docstring, and the single line `return set(s0) == set(s1)`\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The implementation logic `return set(s0) == set(s1)` is correct - it converts both strings to sets of unique characters and compares them for equality. The only issue is the extraneous analysis text that contains invalid Python syntax characters.\n\n**Result**: The function should be just:\n```python\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\n    [docstring examples...]\n    \"\"\"\n    return set(s0) == set(s1)\n```",
