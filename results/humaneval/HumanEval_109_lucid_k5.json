      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The error is a syntax error caused by an apostrophe in a comment line that's being interpreted as a string delimiter.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Line 36** (in the docstring/comment section):\n```\n5. If there's exactly one break point, the elements after it should connect properly with elements before it\n```\n\nChange to:\n```\n5. If there is exactly one break point, the elements after it should connect properly with elements before it\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe apostrophe in \"there's\" is being interpreted as the start of a string literal, causing Python to think the string is unterminated. Replacing the contraction with \"there is\" removes the apostrophe and resolves the syntax error.\n\n**Alternative fix**: Escape the apostrophe or use a different quote style for the docstring, but the simplest solution is to avoid contractions in the comment.",
