      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is correct, but there's explanatory text mixed into the code block that's causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove lines 2-6 from the code block (the explanation text that starts with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the example trace).\n\n**The fix**:\n- Keep only the actual Python function implementation\n- Remove all the natural language explanation that appears before the function definition\n- The function code itself (lines starting with `def intersperse...` through `return result`) is correct and should remain unchanged\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the explanation text as code. The arrow character `\u2192` and the natural language text are not valid Python syntax. By removing the explanation and keeping only the function implementation, the code will be syntactically valid and should pass the tests.",
