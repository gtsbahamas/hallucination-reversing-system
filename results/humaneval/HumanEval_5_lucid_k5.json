There's a syntax error because the triple-quoted docstring that starts on line 2 is never closed before the code begins.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Line 2-7**: The docstring is currently missing its closing `\"\"\"`. \n- Add `\"\"\"` at the end of line 7 (after the second doctest example) to properly close the docstring.\n\n**Specific change**:\n```python\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\"  # <-- Add this closing triple-quote\n    if not numbers:\n        return []\n    # ... rest of code\n```\n\n**Why this fixes it**: Python requires all string literals (including docstrings) to be properly terminated. The opening `\"\"\"` on line 2 needs a matching closing `\"\"\"` before any executable code begins. Without it, Python treats everything after as part of the string literal, causing a syntax error.",
