      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that my explanation text was included in the code file, causing a syntax error. The implementation itself is correct, but I need to provide only the function code without the explanatory comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The explanation text with special characters (\u2192) was included in the code, causing a SyntaxError.\n\n**Solution**: Remove all the explanatory text that appears before the function definition. Keep only:\n1. The function definition\n2. The docstring\n3. The implementation code with appropriate comments\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines**: Remove all text from \"Looking at the `encode_cyclic` function...\" through \"...\u2192 \"abc\" \u2713\" (everything before the `def decode_cyclic` line)\n- **Keep**: Only the function definition starting with `def decode_cyclic(s: str):` and its implementation\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The explanatory text contains invalid Python syntax (prose and special Unicode characters). Python files should only contain valid Python code, comments (starting with #), and docstrings (within triple quotes).\n\nThe actual implementation logic `(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group` is correct - it reverses the cyclic encoding by moving the last character to the front for groups of length 3.",
