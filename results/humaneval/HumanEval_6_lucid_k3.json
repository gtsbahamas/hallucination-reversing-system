      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is placed inside the docstring instead of after it.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 4-32\n\n**Fix**:\n1. Close the docstring after line 11 (after the doctest example)\n2. Move the implementation code (lines 13-32) outside and after the docstring\n3. Remove the explanatory comments that are currently between the docstring and the implementation\n\n**Corrected structure**:\n```python\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.\n    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.\n\n    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')\n    [2, 3, 1, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    groups = paren_string.split()\n    result = []\n    \n    for group in groups:\n        max_depth = 0\n        current_depth = 0\n        \n        for char in group:\n            if char == '(':\n                current_depth += 1\n                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)\n            elif char == ')':\n                current_depth -= 1\n        \n        result.append(max_depth)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The docstring wasn't properly closed with `\"\"\"`, causing Python to interpret the subsequent code as part of the string literal, leading to a syntax error.",
