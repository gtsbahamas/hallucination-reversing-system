The text needs to be either:\n1. Inside a string (like a docstring)\n2. Prefixed with `#` to make it a comment\n3. Removed entirely\n\nThe actual function implementation (lines 14-29) is correct and doesn't need changes. Once the syntax error is resolved by removing/commenting the explanatory text, the function will work as intended.",
