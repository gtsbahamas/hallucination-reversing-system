When it encounters `Count` (text), it throws a `SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal`. Using `#` properly comments out the line so Python ignores it during execution.\n\n**Note:** The actual function implementation (the `def max_fill` block at the end) appears correct and doesn't need changes. Only the explanatory text before it needs to be properly commented or removed.",
