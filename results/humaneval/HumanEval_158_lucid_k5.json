      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code has a syntax error due to an unterminated string literal. Looking at line 15, there's an apostrophe in \"there's\" that's breaking the string.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 15 (in the comment section)\n\n**What to fix**: \n- Change `2. If there's a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word` \n- To: `2. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word`\n- OR escape the apostrophe: `2. If there\\'s a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word`\n- OR use different quotes for the docstring/comment\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe apostrophe in \"there's\" is being interpreted as a string delimiter, causing Python to think the string ends prematurely. This creates an unterminated string literal error. Removing or escaping the apostrophe resolves the syntax error.\n\n**Note**: The actual implementation logic appears correct for the problem requirements. Once the syntax error is fixed, the function should work as intended:\n1. It finds the maximum number of unique characters\n2. Filters words with that count\n3. Returns the lexicographically smallest among them",
