All explanatory text must be in comments (`#`) or docstrings (`\"\"\"`). The actual decoding logic `(group[-1] + group[:-1])` is correct - it reverses the encoding by moving the last character to the front.",

This is a scope/import issue, not a logic issue with the decoding algorithm itself.\n\n**Fix**: \n- Ensure `encode_cyclic` is defined in the same file/module before `decode_cyclic`\n- Or if submitting just `decode_cyclic`, include `encode_cyclic` in the submission\n\n**Note on the algorithm**: The current decoding logic is actually correct:\n- `encode_cyclic` does: `group[1:] + group[0]` (moves first char to end)\n- `decode_cyclic` does: `group[-1] + group[:-1]` (moves last char to front)\n- This correctly reverses the encoding operation\n\nThe implementation logic is sound; it's purely a missing function definition issue in the test environment.",
