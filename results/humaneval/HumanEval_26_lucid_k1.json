      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains markdown-style text (\"Looking at this problem...\" and \"Here's the implementation:\") that's not valid Python syntax, causing a SyntaxError.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Remove all the explanatory text before the function definition\n- **Keep only**: The actual function implementation starting from `def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:`\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Delete lines 1-9 (all the explanatory text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Here's the implementation:\")\n2. Keep the function definition and its body (the `from collections import Counter` through the return statement)\n\n**Why this fixes it**: \nThe explanatory text is not valid Python code. Only the actual function definition and implementation should be present. The logic itself is correct - it counts occurrences and filters to keep only numbers appearing exactly once while maintaining order.\n\n**Final structure should be**:\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    from collections import Counter\n    counts = Counter(numbers)\n    return [num for num in numbers if counts[num] == 1]\n```",
