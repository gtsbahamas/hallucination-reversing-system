But more importantly, let me analyze the logic:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The code has a syntax error from unescaped backticks in comments, but the main logical issue is in the even formula calculation.\n\n**Lines to change**:\n\n1. **Line with `result[i] = 1 + i // 2`** (in the even positions loop)\n   - **Current**: `result[i] = 1 + i // 2`\n   - **Fix**: `result[i] = 1 + i / 2`\n   - **Why**: The specification says `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` for even n. Using integer division `//` gives wrong results. For example, `tri(2)` should be `1 + 2/2 = 2.0` but `1 + 2//2 = 2` works here. However, for larger even numbers, the difference matters if we want exact float division as specified.\n\n2. **Remove or fix the comment lines** (lines 38-39 in the strategy section)\n   - **Current**: Comments with backticks causing syntax error\n   - **Fix**: Either remove backticks or remove those comment lines entirely\n   - **Why**: Backticks aren't properly escaped and cause syntax errors\n\n**Corrected approach**:\n- Keep the two-pass strategy (even indices first, then odd indices)\n- Use regular division `/` instead of integer division `//` for the even formula\n- Clean up comments to avoid syntax errors\n\nThe logic of computing even positions first, then odd positions is correct since odd positions depend on `tri(n+1)` which will be available after computing even positions.",
