      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's explanatory text outside of the function that's being treated as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: Lines 14+ contain natural language explanation that should be removed or commented out. The Python interpreter is trying to execute \"Looking at this problem...\" as code.\n\n**Solution**: \n1. **Delete lines 14-44** (all the explanatory text starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the end)\n2. **Keep only the function definition** (lines 1-13)\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The syntax error occurs because uncommented English text is invalid Python syntax. The function implementation itself (lines 1-13) is correct and handles all the edge cases properly:\n- Special case for `n == 1`\n- Special case for `n == 0`\n- Special case for `x == 1`\n- Handles negative bases\n- Uses division method for positive cases\n\nThe implementation logic is sound; it just needs the non-code text removed.",
