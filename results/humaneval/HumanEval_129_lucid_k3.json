This causes a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 1-31 (the explanatory text before the function)\n\n**What to fix:**\n- Remove all the explanatory text that appears before the `def minPath(grid, k):` line\n- The actual function implementation (starting from `def minPath(grid, k):` onwards) is correct and should be kept as-is\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe Python interpreter is trying to execute plain English text as Python code, which causes a syntax error. The explanatory text was meant to be reasoning/comments but was left as raw text. Removing it will leave only valid Python code (the function definition and implementation), which will execute correctly.\n\nThe actual algorithm implementation is sound:\n1. It finds the minimum value (1) in the grid\n2. Starts the path from that position\n3. For each subsequent step, examines all valid neighbors and picks the one with minimum value\n4. Builds the path by appending these minimum values\n\nThis correctly produces lexicographically smallest paths as required by the specification.",
