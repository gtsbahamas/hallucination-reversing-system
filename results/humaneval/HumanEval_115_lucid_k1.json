      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains **plain text comments that aren't properly formatted as Python comments**. The lines starting with `-` are being interpreted as Python code rather than comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 2-5 in the implementation (the bullet points explaining the approach)\n\n**The fix:**\nRemove or properly comment out these lines:\n```\n- Count the total water units in each well (each row)\n- Calculate how many bucket trips are needed for each well\n- Sum up all the trips\n```\n\nThese are documentation/explanation lines that were left in the code body. They need to be either:\n1. Removed entirely, OR\n2. Prefixed with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nPython is trying to parse `- Count the number...` as a statement, which causes a syntax error because `-` followed by text isn't valid Python syntax. The actual algorithm implementation (lines 6-11) is correct and matches the specification perfectly.\n\n**Recommended fix:**\nSimply delete lines 2-5 (the bullet points), keeping only:\n```python\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    total_trips = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        water_units = sum(row)\n        trips_needed = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)\n        total_trips += trips_needed\n    return total_trips\n```",
