      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the code. The problem is that the docstring contains a numbered list that's being interpreted as code rather than as part of the docstring.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation reasoning (lines with \"Key observations:\", numbered points 1-5, and explanation) is placed *outside* the function's docstring, causing Python to try to parse it as code. The numbered list item \"4.\" is being interpreted as a float, leading to the syntax error.\n\n**Fix**: Remove all the explanatory text that appears between the docstring and the `return` statement.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines**: All lines from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...exactly once.\" (everything between the closing `\"\"\"` of the docstring and the `return n * n` statement)\n- **Keep**: Only the function definition, its docstring, and the `return n * n` statement\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The explanatory reasoning should not be part of the function body. It's causing a syntax error because Python is trying to execute it as code. The actual implementation (`return n * n`) is correct - each of n left-to-right cars collides with each of n right-to-left cars, giving n\u00b2 total collisions.\n\n**Result**: The function should only contain:\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"[docstring]\"\"\"\n    return n * n\n```",
