      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the docstring - it contains unescaped quotes that are breaking the string literal. However, the main issue is that the implementation is overly complex and doesn't handle all cases correctly.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire function needs to be rewritten more simply.\n\n**The fix:**\n\n1. **Remove the complex docstring reasoning** (lines causing syntax error) - keep only the original docstring from the specification.\n\n2. **Simplify the logic** to handle these cases in order:\n   - If `n == 1`: return `x == 1` (since 1^k = 1 for all k)\n   - If `n == -1`: return `x == 1 or x == -1` (since (-1)^even = 1, (-1)^odd = -1)\n   - If `n == 0`: return `x == 0` (since 0^k = 0 for k > 0)\n   - If `x == 1`: return `True` (since any n^0 = 1, except n=0)\n   - If `x == 0`: return `n == 0` (only 0^k = 0)\n   \n3. **For the general case** (n not in {-1, 0, 1}):\n   - Use an iterative approach starting with `power = 1`\n   - Keep multiplying by `n` while the absolute value doesn't exceed `abs(x)`\n   - Check if we hit `x` exactly\n   - This handles both positive and negative values of n and x\n\n4. **Remove the logarithm approach** - it has precision issues and doesn't handle negative numbers well.\n\n5. **Remove the negative power checking** - the problem asks for integer powers, and the examples don't show fractional results.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- Eliminates syntax error from malformed docstring\n- Handles edge cases (n=0, n=1, n=-1, x=0, x=1) explicitly\n- Uses simple iteration that works for all integer cases\n- Avoids floating-point precision issues from logarithms\n- Correctly interprets \"n**int=x\" as requiring an integer exponent",
