      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains markdown-style comments and explanatory text that are not valid Python syntax. The actual function implementation is correct, but it's embedded in a larger text block that causes a syntax error.\n\n**Fix**:\nRemove all the explanatory text and markdown formatting, keeping only the valid Python function definition.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n- **Delete lines 1-25**: Remove all the text starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"I'll go with the second approach as it's cleaner:\"\n- **Keep only the function definition** (the last 7 lines):\n  ```python\n  def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n      if not numbers:\n          return []\n      \n      result = [numbers[0]]\n      for num in numbers[1:]:\n          result.append(delimeter)\n          result.append(num)\n      \n      return result\n  ```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the explanatory text as code. The string literal starting with the triple backticks on line 26 is never closed, causing the \"unterminated string literal\" error. By removing all non-code text and keeping only the function implementation, the file will contain valid Python syntax.",
