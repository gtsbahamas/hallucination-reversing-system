      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue with the test file itself (invalid character), but let me focus on the actual logic problem.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue**: The length calculation is incorrect. Based on the specification example, \"the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3) which its length is 1\", the length should be calculated as `end - start` (not `end - start + 1`), representing the number of integers in the interval minus 1, or the \"distance\" between endpoints.\n\nHowever, re-reading more carefully: for closed intervals, the number of integers from 2 to 3 inclusive is 2 (the numbers 2 and 3). But the problem says the length is 1. This suggests \"length\" means the mathematical length/distance, not the count of integers.\n\n**Lines to change**: Line 19\n```python\nlength = intersect_end - intersect_start\n```\n\n**Why this is already correct**: Actually, the current implementation already uses `intersect_end - intersect_start`, which matches the specification's example.\n\n**Real issue**: Looking at the test case `intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))`:\n- Intersection: (0, 1)\n- Length: 1 - 0 = 1\n- Is 1 prime? No (correctly returns \"NO\")\n\nThe logic appears correct. The syntax error in the test file is preventing execution. The implementation itself should work correctly once the test file's syntax issues (the arrow character `\u2192`) are removed from the comments/docstring.\n\n**No code changes needed** - the implementation is correct. The test failure is due to invalid Unicode characters in the test file comments, not the function logic.",
