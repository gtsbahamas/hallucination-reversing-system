      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring contains unescaped quotes and special characters that are causing a syntax error.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-28 (the entire docstring)\n\n**Fix**: \n1. Use triple double-quotes (`\"\"\"`) for the docstring instead of mixing quote styles\n2. Escape or remove the special character `\u2264` in line 5 of the algorithm comments (line 36 in the file)\n3. Alternatively, move the detailed algorithm explanation outside the docstring as regular comments\n\n**Specific change**:\nReplace line 5 in the algorithm section:\n```python\n5. If there's exactly one break point, the element after it should be \u2264 the first element, and the element before it should be \u2264 the last element (to maintain sorted order after rotation)\n```\n\nWith:\n```python\n5. If there's exactly one break point, the element after it should be <= the first element, and the element before it should be <= the last element (to maintain sorted order after rotation)\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe special Unicode character `\u2264` inside the string is not being properly handled, causing Python to think the string literal is unterminated. Replacing it with the ASCII equivalent `<=` or removing the algorithm comments from the docstring entirely will resolve the syntax error.\n\n**Alternative approach**: Move the \"Looking at this problem...\" section and algorithm explanation to be regular comments (using `#`) after the docstring ends, before the function implementation begins.",
