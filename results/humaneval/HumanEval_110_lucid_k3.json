The error message shows that Python is encountering text that shouldn't be there - specifically, the explanation text \"Looking at this problem...\" appears to be in the actual Python file where it shouldn't be.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation reasoning/explanation text is being included in the Python file itself, causing a syntax error. This text should be removed - only the actual function implementation should remain.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Remove lines**: Delete all the explanatory text that appears before the function definition (starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...return 'NO'\")\n- **Keep**: Only the actual `def exchange(lst1, lst2):` function with its docstring and implementation code\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Delete everything between the docstring and the actual function implementation\n2. The file should contain only:\n   - The function definition line\n   - The docstring\n   - The implementation (the 4 lines of actual code: even_count_lst1, even_count_lst2, total_evens, and the if/else return statements)\n\n**Why this fixes it**: The explanatory text is not valid Python syntax. It's being interpreted as code, which causes the SyntaxError. Removing it leaves only the valid Python function implementation.",
