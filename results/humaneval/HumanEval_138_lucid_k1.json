      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that the implementation reasoning text was included in the Python file, causing a syntax error. The actual function implementation is correct, but it needs to be isolated from the explanatory text.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The explanatory text \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...n % 2 == 0\" is being treated as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Solution**: Remove all the explanatory text and keep only the function definition.\n\n**Lines to change**: \n- Delete everything between the docstring and the function definition\n- Keep only:\n  1. The function signature: `def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):`\n  2. The docstring\n  3. The return statement: `return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe logic itself is correct (a number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers if and only if it's even and >= 8). The syntax error occurs because non-code text is being interpreted as Python statements. Removing the explanatory text will leave only valid Python code.",
