      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is that there's explanatory text mixed into the Python code, causing a syntax error. The implementation logic itself appears correct, but it needs to be properly formatted as a Python function.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove all the explanatory text that appears before and within the function definition (lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"So the pattern is:\").\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Keep only the actual Python function definition starting with `def tri(n):`\n2. Remove all the prose explanation text\n3. The function implementation itself (the actual code) is correct and should remain unchanged\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse English text as Python code. The text \"Looking at this problem, I need to understand...\" is not valid Python syntax. By removing all non-code text and keeping only the function definition and its implementation, the syntax error will be resolved.\n\n**Specific action:**\nDelete everything before `def tri(n):` and keep only the function code block (lines with `def tri(n):` through `return result`).",
