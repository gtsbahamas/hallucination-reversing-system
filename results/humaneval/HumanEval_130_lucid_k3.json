The explanation should be removed, leaving only the valid Python function.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove all the explanatory text before the function definition (lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\" through the trace example).\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Delete all text from \"Looking at this problem...\" up to (but not including) the `def tri(n):` line\n2. Keep only the function definition and its body\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe Python interpreter is trying to parse the English explanation as Python code, which causes a `SyntaxError`. Python files should only contain valid Python syntax (code, comments with `#`, or docstrings within triple quotes). The explanation text is neither commented out nor part of a docstring, so it's being interpreted as invalid Python statements.\n\nThe actual implementation logic appears correct based on the specification, so once the syntax error is removed by deleting the explanatory prose, the function should work properly.",
