The actual implementation of `decode_cyclic` is correct, but it needs to be provided without the explanatory comments that contain invalid characters.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The response included explanatory text with special Unicode characters (\u2192) that was interpreted as Python code, causing a SyntaxError.\n\n**Solution**: Provide only the valid Python function implementation without the detailed explanation in the code.\n\n**The correct implementation** (which was already in my response but mixed with explanation):\n\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # reverse cycle elements in each group.
