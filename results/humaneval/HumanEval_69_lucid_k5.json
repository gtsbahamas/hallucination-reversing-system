      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the docstring comment in the implementation is not properly formatted as a Python comment or string. The numbered list items (1., 2., 3.) are being interpreted as Python code rather than comments.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Lines 1-3 of the implementation (the numbered list)\n\n**The fix:**\nAdd `#` at the beginning of each line to make them proper Python comments:\n```python\n# 1. Count the frequency of each integer in the list\n# 2. Find integers where frequency >= the integer's value\n# 3. Return the greatest such integer, or -1 if none exist\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse `2. Find integers...` as code. The period after `2` makes Python think it's a float literal, but then the rest of the line contains invalid syntax. By adding `#` at the start of each line, these become comments and are ignored by the Python parser.\n\nThe actual implementation code (the `from collections import Counter` onwards) is correct and doesn't need any changes.",
