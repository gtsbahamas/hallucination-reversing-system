      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a **syntax error** in the code - the docstring or a string literal is not properly terminated.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code has been inserted into what appears to be a comment or planning section, causing Python to interpret the text as code rather than comments.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 18-29 (the \"Approach:\" section and trace examples)\n\n**Fix**: \n1. Remove or properly comment out lines 18-29 (the planning text that starts with \"Approach:\" and includes the trace examples)\n2. These lines should either be:\n   - Deleted entirely, OR\n   - Converted to proper Python comments by prefixing each line with `#`, OR\n   - Wrapped in a multi-line string with proper `\"\"\"` delimiters\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse plain English text as Python code. The line \"- Make sure we're not using the same element twice...\" is being interpreted as a subtraction operation with an incomplete string literal. By removing or properly commenting this planning text, Python will only see valid Python syntax.\n\n**Note**: The actual algorithm implementation (lines 30-37) appears correct and doesn't need changes - it properly uses a set to track seen numbers and checks if the negative exists.",
