The `\u2192` (U+2192) is a Unicode character that's causing the parser to fail.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n```\nLine 14: Change '\u2192' to '->'\nLine 15: Change '\u2192' to '->'  \nLine 16: Change '\u2192' to '->'\nLine 17: Change '\u2192' to '->'\n```\n\nAlternatively, simply remove these comment lines entirely since they're just analysis notes and not needed in the final implementation.",
