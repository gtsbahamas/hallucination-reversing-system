      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a syntax error caused by the checkmark character '\u2713' in what appears to be a comment or docstring that's not properly formatted.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The character '\u2713' (U+2713) is appearing in the code outside of a string or comment context, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Root Cause**: The \"Current implementation\" section includes explanation text that was meant to be comments but wasn't properly formatted as Python comments.\n\n**Fix**: Remove or properly comment out the explanation text that appears before the function definition. Specifically:\n\n1. **Lines to remove/fix**: All the explanatory text from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"Here's the implementation:\" including:\n   - \"Looking at this problem, I need to calculate the product of all factorials from 1! to n!.\"\n   - The trace through example section\n   - \"Here's the implementation:\"\n\n2. **What to do**: Either:\n   - Delete these lines entirely (they're not part of the function code)\n   - Or prefix each line with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n\n3. **Why this fixes it**: The Python interpreter is trying to parse these lines as code. The checkmark symbol and the mathematical notation aren't valid Python syntax. By removing or commenting these lines, only the actual function definition remains, which is syntactically correct.\n\n**The actual function code (lines starting with `def special_factorial(n):` through `return result`) is correct and doesn't need any changes.**",
