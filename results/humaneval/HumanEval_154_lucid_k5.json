These comments were left in the code when they should have been removed.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** Remove lines 10-16 (all the comment lines starting with `- \\`cycpattern_check...`)\n\n**The fix:** Delete the entire block of explanatory comments that trace through the examples. These lines contain the \u2192 character which is invalid Python syntax.\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:** The syntax error is caused by non-ASCII characters in what Python is trying to parse as code. These are documentation/explanation lines that were accidentally left in the function body. Removing them will leave only the valid Python implementation (lines 17-21 in the current code).\n\nThe actual algorithm implementation (the for loop that generates rotations and checks if they're substrings) is correct and doesn't need any changes.",
