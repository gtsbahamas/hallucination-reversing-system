      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a syntax error because the comment contains a special Unicode character (\u2713) that's causing Python to fail parsing.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line 24 (the comment line with the checkmark)\n\n**The fix:** Remove or replace the Unicode checkmark character (\u2713) with a regular ASCII character or just remove it entirely.\n\n**Specific change:**\n```python\n# Change this line:\n- Sum of digits: 1 + 8 + 1 = 10 \u2713\n\n# To this:\n- Sum of digits: 1 + 8 + 1 = 10\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:** \nThe Python parser encountered an invalid Unicode character (\u2713, U+2713) in what should be a comment. While Python 3 supports Unicode in strings and comments, this particular character is being interpreted as code rather than part of a comment, likely because the comment formatting is malformed. The simplest fix is to remove the special character entirely, keeping only standard ASCII characters in comments.\n\n**Note:** The actual implementation logic appears correct based on the specification. The only issue is this syntax error preventing the code from running.",
