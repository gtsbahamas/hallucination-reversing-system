While these should technically be allowed in comments, they're causing a syntax error. Removing them will allow the code to parse correctly.\n\n**Alternative**: Simply delete lines 21-23 entirely since they're just verification comments and not needed for the function to work.\n\nThe actual logic of the function (`return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0`) is correct and doesn't need to change.",
