      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the docstring/comments. But more importantly, let me analyze the logic:\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem Identified:**\nThe current approach has a fundamental flaw. It greedily moves to the smallest neighbor at each step, but this doesn't guarantee the lexicographically smallest path. Once we start at the minimum value cell, we should consider what happens when we need to take multiple steps.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nAfter starting at the cell with value 1 (the global minimum), for the remaining k-1 steps, we should always move to whichever neighbor has the smallest value. If that neighbor happens to be smaller than our current cell, we go there. Otherwise, we might oscillate between current and smallest neighbor.\n\nActually, the optimal strategy is simpler: \n- Start at the cell containing value 1 (global minimum)\n- For each subsequent step, move to the neighbor with the smallest value\n- This creates a path that's lexicographically minimal\n\n**Specific Fix:**\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire path-building logic (lines after finding min_pos)\n\n**The fix:**\n1. Remove the syntax error in comments (line 37 area)\n2. Fix the path building logic:\n   - Start at position with value 1\n   - For remaining k-1 steps: find the minimum value among ALL neighbors of current position\n   - Move to that neighbor\n   - Add its value to path\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- Starting at 1 ensures the first element is minimal\n- At each step, choosing the smallest neighbor ensures we get the lexicographically smallest continuation\n- The greedy approach works because we're building the path left-to-right, and at each position we want the smallest possible value\n\n**Corrected approach:**\n```\nAfter finding min_pos (cell with value 1):\n- path = [grid[min_pos]]\n- current_pos = min_pos\n- For i in range(k-1):\n    - Get all neighbors of current_pos\n    - Find neighbor with minimum value\n    - current_pos = that neighbor's position\n    - Append that neighbor's value to path\n```\n\nThe current implementation is actually close, but the syntax error needs fixing and the logic is correct.",
