      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The code itself is correct, but there's a syntax error in the **comment/docstring** section. The character '\u00b3' (superscript 3, Unicode U+00B3) is causing a SyntaxError.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Line 2** (in the comment section): Replace '\u00b3' with '^3' or '**3'\n  - Change: `2. For negative numbers, the cube root will also be negative (e.g., (-1)\u00b3 = -1)`\n  - To: `2. For negative numbers, the cube root will also be negative (e.g., (-1)^3 = -1)`\n\n- **Line 3** (in the comment section): Replace '\u00b3' with '^3' or '**3'\n  - Change: `3. Zero is a perfect cube (0\u00b3 = 0)`\n  - To: `3. Zero is a perfect cube (0^3 = 0)`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nPython source code must use ASCII characters. The superscript '\u00b3' is a Unicode character that's not valid in Python comments when the file encoding isn't properly declared. Using standard ASCII characters like '^3' or '**3' ensures compatibility.\n\n**Note**: The actual function implementation (lines with `def iscube(a):` and the code inside) is correct and doesn't need changes. Only the comments in the \"Key observations\" section need to be fixed.",
