      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring is not properly closed. The implementation code starts immediately after the function signature without closing the docstring first.\n\n**Fix**:\n\n**Line 1-16**: Remove the entire \"Looking at this problem...\" commentary block. This text should not be inside the function - it appears to be reasoning that was accidentally included.\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Delete lines 1-15 (the entire \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"I'll handle edge cases first...\" block)\n2. Keep the proper docstring (lines that start with `\"\"\"Your task is to write...` and end with `\"\"\"`)\n3. Keep all the implementation code starting from `# Handle edge cases`\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \n- The function currently has explanatory text between the function signature and the actual docstring, which Python interprets as code\n- The numbered list with backticks creates invalid Python syntax\n- Removing this commentary leaves only the proper docstring and implementation code, which will parse correctly\n\nThe actual implementation logic appears sound - it just needs the syntax error from the misplaced commentary removed.",
