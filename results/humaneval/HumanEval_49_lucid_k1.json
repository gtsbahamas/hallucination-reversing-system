The checkmark character '\u2713' (U+2713) is causing a SyntaxError.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Remove or replace the analysis comments that contain the '\u2713' character (lines with the checkmark symbols)\n- **What to do**: Delete the entire comment block that starts with \"Looking at this function...\" and contains the test case analysis with checkmarks\n- **Why this fixes it**: The checkmark character is not valid in Python source code outside of string literals. Removing these comments eliminates the syntax error while keeping the correct implementation intact.\n\n**The actual function implementation `return pow(2, n, p)` is correct and should remain unchanged.**",
