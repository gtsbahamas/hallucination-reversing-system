      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation contains explanatory comments that are not properly formatted as Python comments. Lines starting with numbers (1., 2., 3.) are being interpreted as code rather than comments.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-3 (the numbered list before the function definition)\n\n**Fix**: \n- Remove or comment out lines 1-3 that contain the numbered explanation\n- These lines should either be deleted entirely or prefixed with `#` to make them proper Python comments\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse `2. If there's a tie...` as code. The string on the previous line (`1. Find the word...`) is unterminated because Python doesn't recognize this as a comment. By removing these explanatory lines (which are redundant given the docstring already explains the function), the code will be syntactically valid.\n\n**Specific change**:\nDelete lines containing:\n```\n1. Find the word with the maximum number of unique characters\n2. If there's a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word\n3. Handle edge cases like empty lists\n```\n\nOr prefix each with `#`:\n```python\n# 1. Find the word with the maximum number of unique characters\n# 2. If there's a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word\n# 3. Handle edge cases like empty lists\n```\n\nThe actual function logic appears correct and doesn't need modification.",
