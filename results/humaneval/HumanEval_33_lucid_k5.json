The code should start directly with:\n\n```python\ndef sort_third(l: list):\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe text \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\" and the subsequent explanation are not valid Python syntax. They need to be either:\n1. Removed entirely, or\n2. Placed inside triple-quoted strings as comments, or\n3. Prefixed with `#` on each line\n\nSince this explanatory text isn't part of the function specification or implementation, it should simply be removed. The function implementation itself (lines 12-28 in the current code) is correct and doesn't need any changes.",
