      "remediation": "Looking at the error, there's a **syntax error** in the code. The issue is that the implementation includes the reasoning/explanation text directly in the Python file, which is causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem:** Lines 1-20 contain plain text explanation that should not be in the Python file. This text is being interpreted as Python code, causing a syntax error.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. **Delete lines 1-20** (all the explanatory text starting from \"Looking at this problem...\" through \"...n \u00d7 n = n\u00b2.\")\n2. **Keep only the function definition** starting at line 22:\n   ```python\n   def car_race_collision(n: int):\n       \"\"\"\n       Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n       ...\n       \"\"\"\n       return n * n\n   ```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- The explanatory text is not valid Python syntax\n- Only the function definition and its implementation should be in the file\n- The logic itself (`return n * n`) is correct - every left-to-right car collides with every right-to-left car exactly once, giving n\u00b2 total collisions\n\nThe actual implementation logic is sound; it's just wrapped in invalid syntax due to the explanation text being included in the code file.",
