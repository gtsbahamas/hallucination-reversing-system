      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: there's a syntax error because the docstring is not properly terminated. The implementation code appears after the docstring's closing `'''`, but the docstring itself seems to be malformed in the actual file.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The docstring is not properly closed, causing Python to interpret the subsequent code as part of the string literal.\n\n**Lines to change**: Lines 1-18 (the docstring section)\n\n**The fix**:\n1. Ensure the opening docstring `'''` on line 2 has a matching closing `'''` before any implementation code\n2. Remove the duplicate explanation text (lines 4-18 in the current implementation) that appears to be outside the docstring but is actually being parsed as part of it\n3. Keep only the original docstring content (lines 2-11 from the specification)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe syntax error occurs because Python sees an opening `'''` but encounters code before finding the closing `'''`. The numbered list starting with \"1. Count the frequency...\" should either be:\n- Removed entirely (it's just planning notes, not needed in final code), OR\n- Converted to regular comments with `#` if you want to keep them\n\n**Corrected structure should be**:\n```\ndef search(lst):\n    '''\n    [original docstring content only]\n    '''\n    from collections import Counter\n    # [rest of implementation]\n```\n\nThe actual implementation logic (Counter, loop, etc.) is correct and doesn't need changes - only the docstring formatting needs to be fixed.",
