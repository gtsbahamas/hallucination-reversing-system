      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code contains non-Python text (the strategy comments) that's causing a syntax error. The actual function implementation is correct, but it's embedded in explanatory text.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Remove all the explanatory text before the function definition (lines starting with \"Looking at this problem...\", \"Key observations:\", \"Strategy:\", \"Let me trace through...\", and the bullet points)\n- **Keep only**: The actual function implementation starting from `def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):` through `return False`\n\n**What to keep**:\n```python\ndef pairs_sum_to_zero(l):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in l:\n        if -num in seen:\n            return True\n        seen.add(num)\n    return False\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: The syntax error occurs because Python is trying to parse the explanatory text as code. The actual algorithm is correct - it uses a set to track seen numbers and checks if the negative of the current number was seen before, ensuring distinct elements. Removing the non-code text will allow the function to execute properly.",
