      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The error message indicates a syntax error with an \"unterminated string literal\", but this is misleading. The actual issue is that the implementation contains markdown formatting (the triple backticks and \"Here's the implementation:\" text) which is not valid Python syntax.\n\n**Fix**:\n- **Lines to change**: Remove lines 10-11 (the markdown text \"Here's the implementation:\" and the opening triple backticks ```python)\n- **Also remove**: Line 27 (the closing triple backticks ```)\n\n**Specific changes**:\n1. Delete the line containing \"Here's the implementation:\"\n2. Delete the line containing \"```python\"\n3. Delete the line containing \"```\"\n4. Keep only the actual Python function implementation (lines 12-26 in the current code)\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe function implementation itself is correct, but it's wrapped in markdown code block syntax which Python interprets as invalid syntax. Removing the markdown formatting leaves only valid Python code. The function logic properly:\n- Handles empty strings\n- Splits and counts letter frequencies\n- Finds the maximum count\n- Returns all letters with that maximum count",
