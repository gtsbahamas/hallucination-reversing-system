      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Problem**: The implementation code is correct, but there's a syntax error in the comments/documentation that's being included in the actual Python file.\n\n**Lines to change**: Remove or fix the example trace comments that contain the invalid Unicode character '\u2192' (arrow symbol).\n\n**Specific fix**:\n- Delete or rewrite lines 22-32 (the comment block starting with \"Let me trace through the examples:\")\n- These are explanatory comments that shouldn't be in the final implementation file\n- The arrow character '\u2192' (U+2192) is causing a SyntaxError\n\n**Why this fixes the issue**: \nThe actual function implementation (lines 33-46 in the current code) is correct. The syntax error is only in the explanatory comments that precede it. Python is trying to parse the arrow character as code, which is invalid syntax. Removing these comments will allow the correct implementation to run.\n\n**Final implementation should be**:\n```python\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    \"\"\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,\n    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\n    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    For example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_even = sum(1 for num in lst1 + lst2 if num % 2 == 0)\n    return \"YES\" if total_even >= len(lst1) else \"NO\"\n```",
