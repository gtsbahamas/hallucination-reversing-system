      "remediation": "Looking at the error, the issue is clear: the implementation contains plain English text that's not in comments or strings, causing a syntax error.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Lines to change:** The entire implementation section (lines with the English explanation and trace-through)\n\n**What to fix:**\n1. Remove all the plain English text that appears before the function definition:\n   - \"Looking at this problem, I need to:\"\n   - The numbered list\n   - \"For each well (row)...\" paragraph\n   - \"Let me trace through Example 1:\" and all the example traces\n\n2. Keep only the actual Python function:\n```python\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    total_trips = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        water_units = sum(row)\n        trips_needed = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)\n        total_trips += trips_needed\n    return total_trips\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe Python interpreter is trying to parse the English text as Python code, which causes a syntax error when it encounters \"For each well (row), I need to count the 1s...\" The \"1s\" is being interpreted as an invalid decimal literal (you can't have a number followed directly by a letter without an operator).\n\nThe actual algorithm implementation is correct - it just needs to be separated from the explanatory text, which should either be removed or converted to comments.",
