      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed because of a **malformed patch format** - it ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. This is a formatting issue with the diff itself, not a logical problem with the approach.\n\nLooking at the patch content, the logic was actually on the right track:\n1. Accept `header_rows` parameter in `__init__`\n2. Pass it to the parent `FixedWidth` class\n3. Adjust the `write()` method to find the correct separator line dynamically\n\nHowever, there were issues:\n\n### Problems with the Previous Approach:\n\n1. **Patch formatting error**: The diff was malformed (missing newline at end)\n2. **Logic issue in `write()`**: The code searches for the first line with `'='` characters, but when `header_rows` is used, there will be multiple lines with `'='` characters (one after each header row). The separator line we want is actually the **last** line before the data starts, not the first.\n3. **Incomplete understanding**: With `header_rows=[\"name\", \"unit\"]`, the parent class",
