      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to access `self.config.invocation_params.dir`, but this attribute doesn't exist in the pytest Config object\n2. The test failed with an image build error, but the underlying issue is that the code would raise an `AttributeError` when trying to access the non-existent attribute\n3. The approach of comparing current directory with invocation directory is conceptually correct, but the implementation used the wrong API\n\n**Key Insights:**\n1. From the code, `self.config` is a pytest Config object, but `invocation_params.dir` is not a valid attribute path\n2. Looking at pytest's architecture, the session object (available as `self.session`) has an `startdir` or `startpath` attribute that represents the initial directory\n3. The test `test_failure_with_changed_cwd` expects that when the working directory changes, pytest should still repo",
