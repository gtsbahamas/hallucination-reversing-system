The patch didn't address baseline alignment.\n\n4. **Incomplete vector printing**: The patch added `_print_BaseVector` and `_print_VectorZero` but didn't handle the actual vector multiplication structure properly.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the example output:\n```\n\u239b   t\u239e e_j\n\u239c\u239bx\u239e e_j \u239f\n\u239c\u239c\u2500\u239f \u239f\n\u239d\u239dy",

The problem in the example `(x/y)**t*e.j` is that:\n- `(x/y)**t` creates a tall prettyForm with superscript\n- When multiplied with `e.j`, the vector gets misaligned\n- The vector should maintain its baseline at the center of the overall expression\n\n### 3. **Test Failure**\nThe Docker ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Import Error Handling is Too Broad**\nThe patch tries to check `isinstance(arg, Vector)` but wraps it in a try-except that catches `ImportError`, `AttributeError`, and `TypeError`. This is problematic because:\n- It silently fails if Vector isn't imported\n- The `has_vector` flag remains False even when vectors are present\n- The baseline adjustment never happens\n\n### 2. **Wrong Approach to Vector Detection**\nThe patch checks if args are instances of `Vector`, but in the multiplication context, vectors are likely wrapped in other expressions (like `Pow` in the example `(x/y)**t*e.j`). The vector `e.j` is a `BaseVector`, not necessarily a direct `Vector` instance.\n\n### 3. **Baseline Calculation is Too Simplistic**\nSetting `pform.baseline = pform.height() // 2` doesn't account for the actual content structure.
