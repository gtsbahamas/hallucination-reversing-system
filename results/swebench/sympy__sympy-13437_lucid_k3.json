However, examining the patch more carefully, there's a potential issue with the placement and logic.\n\n**The actual issue:**\nThe previous patch added the infinity check at the beginning of `eval()`, but it needs to handle the case properly for all three calling modes of `bell()`:\n1. `bell(n)` - Bell numbers\n2. `bell(n, x)` - Bell polynomials  \n3. `bell(n, k, symbols)` - Incomplete Bell polynomials\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. The patch should return `S.Infinity` when `n` is infinity for the Bell number case (when `k_sym` and `symbols` are both `None`)\n2. For Bell polynomials `bell(n, x)` where n\u2192\u221e, the behavior should also be infinity\n3. For incomplete Bell polynomials, the behavior with infinity is less clear and may need different handling\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe corrected ",
