While `SimpleLazyObject` inherits from `LazyObject`, the issue is that **the patch was placed in the wrong location** - it was added to `LazyObject` but the actual test failure suggests the methods aren't being found or aren't working correctly.\n\nHowever, the real issue is more subtle: The test output shows a Docker image build failure, not an actual test failure. This means we can't see the real test results. But based on the code structure, I can identify the likely problem:\n\n## Key Issues with Previous Patch\n\n1. **Lambda function signature**: The `__radd__` implementation uses `lambda a, b: operator.add(b, a)`, but when used with `new_method_proxy`, the first argument `a` will be `self._wrapped`, not the SimpleLazyObject itself.\n\n2. **Argument order confusion**: In `n",

While `SimpleLazyObject` inherits from `LazyObject`, the issue is that **`SimpleLazyObject` already has `__add__` defined implicitly** through the `__getattr__` proxy mechanism.\n\nThe real problem is:\n1. When you do `lazy_obj + other`, Python calls `lazy_obj.__add__(other)`, which works via `__getattr__` proxy\n2. When you do `other + lazy_obj`, Python calls `other.__add__(lazy_obj)` first, and if that returns `NotImplemented`, then Python tries `lazy_obj.__radd__(other)`\n3. **`__radd__` is NOT found via `__getattr__`** because Python's special method lookup bypasses `__getattr__` and looks directly in the class dictionary\n\n## Key Insight from Test Failure\n\nThe test failure appears to be an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not a logic error.

However, there's a critical problem:\n\n**The `LazyObject` class already has `__add__` defined via `new_method_proxy`** - it's inherited through the dynamic proxy mechanism. By explicitly defining `__add__` as a regular method, we're overriding the proxy behavior, which could break existing functionality.\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n1. `LazyObject` uses `new_method_proxy` for most operations\n2. `SimpleLazyObject` inherits from `LazyObject`\n3. The issue specifically mentions `SimpleLazyObject` needs `__radd__`\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **`__add__` should use `new_method_proxy`**: The existing pattern in the codebase uses `new_method_proxy(operator.add)` for binary operations like `__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.\n\n2. **`__radd__` needs special handling**: As noted in the issue, `operator.radd` doesn't exist.",
