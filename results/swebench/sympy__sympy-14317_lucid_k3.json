The `order` parameter passed to `_print_Add` doesn't necessarily match how the printer's `order` setting works\n3. The patch doesn't properly handle the case where we need to respect the printer's existing order settings\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\n\nThe test passed, which means the logic was partially correct, but the approach of directly calling `_print_Add` is fragile and doesn't properly integrate with the printer's order management system.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the `_print_Add` method:\n```python\ndef _print_Add(self, expr, order=None):\n    if self.order == 'none':\n        terms = list(expr.args)\n    else",

This is a formatting issue, not a logic issue.\n\nLooking at the patch content, the logic approach was sound:\n1. Get the polynomial expression via `poly.as_expr()`\n2. Check if it's an `Add` expression\n3. If so, use `_as_ordered_terms()` to order terms properly\n4. Print the ordered expression\n\nHowever, there are two issues:\n\n### Issues with the Previous Approach:\n\n1. **Patch formatting error**: The patch was truncated/malformed\n2. **Logic issue**: Using `Add(*terms, evaluate=False)` may not preserve the desired order when printed, because `_print_Add` has its own ordering logic that could override our manual ordering\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **In `_print_Poly` method**: Instead of trying to reorder the `Add` expression and then printing it, we should directly control the term ordering when printing\n2. **Key i",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incorrect Add construction**: The patch creates `Add(*terms, evaluate=False)` which doesn't preserve the original expression structure properly.\n\n2. **Recursion issue**: Calling `_print_Add` with `order='none'` after already ordering terms is redundant and may cause issues since `_print_Add` expects to handle ordering itself.\n\n3. **Loss of expression semantics**: Converting to Add and back loses important information about the polynomial structure.\n\n4. **Docker image error**: The test infrastructure failed, but the logical issues in the patch are clear from the code.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Root cause**: The `_print_Poly` method calls `poly.as_expr()` which returns an Add expression, but when this Add is printed via `_print(expr_obj)`, it goes through `_print_Add` which may reorder terms based on `default_sort_key` rather than polynomial de",
