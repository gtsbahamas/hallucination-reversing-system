However, let me analyze the previous patch to identify potential problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incomplete logic flow**: The patch removed the early return when `encoding is None`, but didn't handle the case where `apparent_encoding` might also be `None` or unavailable.\n\n2. **Missing error handling**: The code assumes `r.apparent_encoding` always exists and returns a valid encoding, but:\n   - `apparent_encoding` is a property that may not be available on all response objects\n   - It could potentially return `None` \n   - It requires the response content to be available for detection\n\n3. **Potential infinite loop/recursion**: `apparent_encoding` property typically reads the response content to detect encoding. If called during iteration, this could cause issues.\n\n## Key Insights from Issue Description\n\n1. The user reports `r.encoding",

However, the test failure shows a Docker image build error, which suggests the patch may have introduced a runtime issue. The core problem is:\n\n1. **`apparent_encoding` is a property that triggers charset detection** - It's computationally expensive and requires accessing `r.content`, which defeats the purpose of streaming with `iter_content()`\n2. **Circular dependency risk** - `apparent_encoding` may try to read the entire response content, which conflicts with the streaming nature of `iter_content()`\n3. **The property might not be available** during iteration if content hasn't been fully received yet\n\n## Key Insights from Issue Discussion\n\nFrom the issue thread:\n- When `r.encoding` is `None`, `decode_unicode=True` currently becomes a no-op that yi",

However, this doesn't match the behavior of `r.text`, which uses `apparent_encoding` as a fallback (auto-detection via chardet).\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nThe maintainer stated: \"There's at least one key difference: `decode_unicode=True` doesn't fall back to `apparent_encoding`, which means it'll never autodetect the encoding.\"\n\nThe goal is to make `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` behave like `r.text` by using the same fallback logic.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Don't hardcode utf-8** - Instead, when `r.encoding` is `None`, we need to use `r.apparent_encoding` as the fallback, just like the `text` property does.\n\n2. **Match the text property behavior** - Looking at how `Response.text` works in `models.py`, it uses:\n   - First tries `se",
