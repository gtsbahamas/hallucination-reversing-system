      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe issue occurs when running `make html epub` - building both HTML and EPUB formats sequentially. The previous patch only checks `viewcode_enable_epub` in the `collect_pages` function, but this happens during the **build-write phase**. \n\nHowever, the `doctree_read` function (which runs during the **read phase**) already populates `env._viewcode_modules` with module information. This environment data persists across multiple builders when building multiple formats in sequence.\n\n**What Went Wrong with Previous Patch:**\n1. When building HTML first, `doctree_read` runs and populates `env._viewcode_modules` (no epub check there for HTML builder)\n2. When building EPUB second, `doctree_read` is skipped (due to the check on line 68), but `env._viewcode_modules` still contains data from the HTML build\n3. The previous patch's check in `collect_pages` prevents page generation, but t",
