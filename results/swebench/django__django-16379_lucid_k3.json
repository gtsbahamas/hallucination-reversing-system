      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and what the actual problem is.\n\n## Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe issue describes a race condition in `has_key()`:\n1. Thread A checks `os.path.exists(fname)` \u2192 returns True\n2. Thread B deletes the file (via `_is_expired()`)\n3. Thread A tries to `open(fname, \"rb\")` \u2192 FileNotFoundError\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch correctly identified the fix:\n- Remove the `os.path.exists()` check\n- Wrap the `open()` call in a try-except to catch `FileNotFoundError`\n\nThis is the right approach because:\n1. It eliminates the race condition window between `exists()` and `open()`\n2. It handles the case where the file is deleted by another thread/process\n3. It's consistent with how `get()` already handles this (it also catches `FileNotFoundError`)\n\n## Why Tests Failed\n\nThe test output shows a Docker image build error, NOT a test failure:\n```\nError building image django__django-16379: 404 Client Error for http+d",
