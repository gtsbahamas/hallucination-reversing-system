The check condition `self.remote_field.symmetrical and self.remote_field.related_name is not None` is too narrow\n2. It only checks if `related_name` is explicitly set, but doesn't account for the fact that `related_name` can be set to `None` or `'+'` to suppress the reverse relation\n3. The check doesn't consider that symmetrical relationships can be implicit (self-referential) or explicit (via `symmetrical=True`)\n\n**Key insights from the issue description:**\n- The issue states: \"if the symmetrical argument is passed, or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, the related field on the target model is not created\"\n- When `symmetrical=True` (or implicitly for self-referential M2M), Django doesn't create a reverse relation\n- Setting `related_name` in this case is useless because it won't be used\n- The check should warn when a developer s",

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the issue is that the test couldn't run due to a Docker image problem, not a code issue. However, I can analyze the previous patch and identify the problem based on the code logic.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch has a **logical flaw** in the condition:\n\n```python\nif (\n    self.remote_field.symmetrical and\n    self._related_name is not None and\n    not self._related_name.endswith('+')\n):\n```\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe condition `not self._related_name.endswith('+')` is incorrect. When `related_name` ends with `'+'`, it means the reverse relation should be suppressed/hidden. This is a **valid use case** even for symmetrical relationships, so we should NOT warn about it.\n\nHowever, the real issue is more subtle: the check should warn when a developer specifies a `related_name` that they expect to work but won't because of symmetry. A `related_name` ending with `'+'` is intentionally suppressing the relation, so that's fine.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe cond",
