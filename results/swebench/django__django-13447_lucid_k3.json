      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, it appears to be an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found) rather than a code issue. However, let me analyze what the previous patch was trying to do and what might be wrong with it.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to:\n1. Rename `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict` (making it public)\n2. Add `'model': model` to the model dictionary\n3. Update references to use the new public method name\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nLooking at the patch more carefully, I notice it **missed updating one reference** in the `app_index` method. The patch shows:\n\n```python\ndef app_index(self, request, app_label, extra_context=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Display the admin dashboard for a single app.\n    \"\"\"\n    app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request, app_label)  # \u2190 Still using old name!\n```\n\nThis would cause an `AttributeError` when `app_index` is called, since `_build_app_dict` no longer exists.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe complete fix needs to:\n\n1. **Rename the method**",
