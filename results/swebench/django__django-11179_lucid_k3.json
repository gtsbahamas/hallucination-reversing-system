More critically, looking at the code structure:\n\n1. Line 278: `if self.can_fast_delete(instance):`\n2. Line 279-280: Delete operation and return\n\nThe issue is that this optimization path (lines 273-281) handles a **single instance** fast delete case, but it returns immediately without setting the PK to None.\n\n**Key insights:**\n1.
