The current implementation only checks if the subclass is **directly in** the `_subclasses` set, not if it's a subclass of any member of that set.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Check direct",

However, **the test results show a Docker image build failure**, not a logic error. This suggests the patch may have worked but couldn't be tested due to infrastructure issues.\n\nHowever, examining the logic more carefully, there's a potential issue with the approach:\n\n### Problem with Previous Patch:\n```python\nreturn any(type.__subclasscheck__(klass, subclass) for klass in cls._subclasses)\n```\n\nThis line checks if `subclass` is a subclass of any `klass` in `_subclasses`, but it's using `type.__subclasscheck__(klass, subclass)` which checks if `subclass` is a subclass of `klass`. This is correct in intent, but the implementation could cause issues because:\n\n1. It's iterating through `cls._subclasses` which contains `",
