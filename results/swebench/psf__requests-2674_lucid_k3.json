However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Import Order Problem**\nThe patch imports `ClosedPoolError` before `Retry`, but then imports `DecodeError` after other imports. This creates an inconsistent and confusing import structure.\n\n### 2. **Missing Import in exceptions.py**\nThe patch adds `ContentDecodingError` that inherits from `BaseHTTPError`, but `BaseHTTPError` is not imported in `exceptions.py`.\n\n### 3. **Incorrect Exception Name in models.py**\nIn `models.py`, line 595, the patch changes `DecodeError` to `_DecodeError` in the except clause, but this is inconsistent - it should remain as the imported alias.\n\n### 4. **Redundant Exception Handling**\nThe patch adds exception handling for `_DecodeError` in both `adapters.py` (lines 351-352 and 369-370) and in `models.py` (lines 651-653).
