      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and understand the core problem.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is that `get_backend()` clears figures from `Gcf.figs` when the first figure was created under `rc_context()`. The hint explains:\n\n1. `rcParams['backend']` starts as an auto-sentinel\n2. `rc_context` stashes this sentinel value\n3. When the first figure is created inside the context, it forces backend resolution (sentinel \u2192 real backend)\n4. On context exit, `rc_context` restores the sentinel\n5. Later, `get_backend()` re-resolves the backend, and because it sees a \"change\" from sentinel to real backend, it closes all figures\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch tried to detect lazy resolution by checking if `old_backend` was the sentinel. However, this logic is flawed because:\n\n1. When `get_backend()` is called after the `rc_context` exits, the backend in the dict IS the sentinel (restored by context exit)\n2. The",
