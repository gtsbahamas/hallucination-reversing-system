      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch used `re.sub(r\"[^\\w.-]\", \"_\", user)` to sanitize the username. However, the `\\w` character class in Python's regex includes alphanumeric characters AND underscores, but its behavior varies by locale and Python version. More critically, **the backslash `\\` character in Windows domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` is NOT being properly handled** because:\n\n1. The regex `[^\\w.-]` means \"anything that's NOT a word character, dot, or hyphen\"\n2. The backslash `\\` should be replaced, but the test is likely failing because the regex pattern itself needs proper escaping or a different approach\n\n**The real issue from the error message:**\n```\nFileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: \n'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\n```\n\nThe path shows `pytest-of-contoso\\john_doe`",
