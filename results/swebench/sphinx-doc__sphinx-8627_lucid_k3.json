      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Import at module level**: The patch imports `from struct import Struct as StructType` at the top of the file. This creates a hard dependency on the struct module and may cause issues in different contexts.\n\n2. **Identity check (`is`) won't work**: The patch uses `cls is StructType` and `annotation is StructType`, but this identity check will fail when the same class is imported differently or accessed via different paths (e.g., `struct.Struct` vs `from struct import Struct`).\n\n3. **Missing the core issue**: The problem is that `struct.Struct.__module__` returns `'builtins'` in Python 3.8 and `'_struct'` in Python 3.9+, not that we need special handling for the identity of the class.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Check the qualified name and module combination** rather than identity\n2. **Handle both the wrong module cases**: \n   - When `__module",

However, I can analyze the previous patch and identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Incorrect placement**: The special case handling was added at the beginning of `restify()` and `stringify()`, but it checks for `cls.__qualname__` which may not exist for all types that reach these functions.\n\n2. **Too narrow check**: The condition `cls.__qualname__ == 'Struct'` only matches exact `Struct` class, but doesn't handle cases where `Struct` might be referenced in different ways (e.g., as part of a generic type, forward reference, etc.).\n\n3. **Missing edge cases**: The patch doesn't handle:\n   - `Struct` when it appears in type annotations like `Optional[struct.Struct]`\n   - `Struct` in Union types\n   - Forward references to `Struct`\n   - The case where `struct.Struct` is imported directly (`from struct import Str",

This is redundant and the early checks may not catch all cases (e.g., when the class is wrapped in a generic).\n\n3. **Missing Module Variable**: In `_stringify_py37`, the variable `module` is used in the struct check but hasn't been ext",
