The issue states that the error arises in `seaborn/_core.py` with the `isnan` ufunc error, which suggests that somewhere downstream, the code is trying to perform numeric operations on mixed types or misaligned data.\n\n**Root cause:**\nThe filtering needs to happen at the DataFrame level (in `plotter.plot_data`), not just on the extracte",

This approach has several critical flaws:\n\n1. **Mutates shared state**: `plotter.plot_data` is shared across multiple mapping operations and plot functions. Filtering it in `HueMapping` affects all subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Wrong location**: The filtering happens too early in the pipeline. `HueMapping` is just one semantic mapping - other mappings (size, style) and the actual plotting functions also need access to the full dataset.\n\n3. **Breaks the separation of concerns**: `HueMapping` should only be responsible for mapping hue values to colors, not filtering the entire dataset.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nFrom the issue description and hints, the actual problem is in `PairGrid`'s delegation logic.
