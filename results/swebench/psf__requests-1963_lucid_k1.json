      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch initialized `prepared_request = req.copy()` before the loop, then immediately overwrote it with `prepared_request = prepared_request.copy()` on the first iteration. This creates a subtle bug: on the first iteration, `prepared_request.copy()` is called when `prepared_request` was just created from `req.copy()`, so it's essentially the same as the original approach for the first redirect. However, the real issue is that this doesn't properly handle the method changes.\n\n**The core problem:**\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. First redirect (303): POST \u2192 GET (method changed correctly)\n2. Second redirect (307): Should preserve GET, but copies from original request which was POST\n\nThe previous patch tried to copy from `prepared_request` instead of `req`, but it still doesn't work correctly because the method changes made in the loop body aren't bein",
