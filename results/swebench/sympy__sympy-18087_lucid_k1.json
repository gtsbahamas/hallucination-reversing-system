      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incomplete logic flow**: The patch added conditions to check if exponents can be safely combined, but the logic has a critical flaw - it falls through to keeping the nested form (`Pow(base, exp)`) in cases where it should still simplify.\n\n2. **Missing case**: When `exp` is NOT one of {-1, 0, 1} but IS an integer, and `e` is also an integer, the code correctly combines them. However, the final `else` clause that keeps `Pow(base, exp)` is too broad and catches cases that should be handled differently.\n\n3. **The real issue**: The problem is specifically with `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` which becomes `Factors({sin(x)**2: S.Half})`. When reconstructing, we have:\n   - `base = sin(x)**2` (a Pow)\n   - `exp = 1/2` (not an integer)\n   - `b = sin(x)`, `e = 2`\n   \n   The patch correctly identifies this shouldn't combine to `sin(x)` (since `sin(x)` could be negative), ",
