      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch\n\nThe previous patch correctly added `__rmul__` to enable left multiplication (e.g., `2.0 * point2`), but the test infrastructure failed due to a Docker image issue, not because of the code itself. However, we need to verify the implementation is correct.\n\n### The Core Issue\n\nThe problem is that when you write `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`, Python calls `point2.__rmul__(2.0)` because the left operand (a SymPy Float) doesn't know how to multiply with a Point. Without `__rmul__`, this fails.\n\nThe expression `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works because it calls `point2.__mul__(2.0)`, which is already defined.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **The patch is conceptually correct**: Adding `__rmul__` that delegates to `__mul__` is the right approach since scalar multiplication is commutative.\n\n2. **The implementation looks good**: The `__rmul__` method simply calls ",

However, the test failure appears to be an infrastructure/Docker issue rather than a code problem - the error message shows \"No such image\" which is unrelated to the patch itself.\n\n## What the Patch Does Right\n\n1. **Correctly implements `__rmul__`**: The method delegates to `__mul__`, which is appropriate since scalar multiplication is commutative\n2. **Proper documentation**: Includes docstring explaining the behavior\n3. **Follows existing patterns**: Mirrors the structure of other operator methods in the class\n\n## Why This Should Work\n\nThe issue states:\n- `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works (calls `Point.__mul__`)\n- `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` fails (needs `Point.__rmul__`)\n\nWhen Python evaluates `2.0 * point2`:\n1.
