      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe patch changed from `'__all__' in dir(self.object)` to `hasattr(self.object, '__all__')`, but this doesn't solve the core issue. The problem is in the logic flow:\n\n1. When `__all__` exists and is empty (`[]`), the condition `hasattr(self.object, '__all__')` is `True`\n2. Then it checks `membername in self.object.__all__`\n3. For an empty `__all__`, this will always be `False` for any member\n4. So `members_check_module` becomes `False`\n5. But the code continues and still documents members because this check is only one part of the filtering logic\n\n**The real issue:**\n\nLooking at the code context around line 1038, when `__all__` is an empty list, the code should recognize that NO members should be documented from this module. However, the current logic only sets `members_check_module = False` for individual members, but doesn't prevent the overal",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch had a logic error in the control flow. It checked `if self.object.__all__:` to determine if `__all__` is non-empty, but this check happens INSIDE the `if hasattr(self.object, '__all__'):` block. The problem is that when `__all__` is an empty list `[]`, the condition `if self.object.__all__:` evaluates to `False`, but then there's no `else` clause to handle this case within that block, so `members_check_module` is never set.\n\nThe code structure was:\n```python\nif hasattr(self.object, '__all__'):\n    if self.object.__all__:\n        members_check_module = membername in self.object.__all__\n    else:\n        members_check_module = False\nelse:\n    members_check_module = True\n```\n\nHowever, looking more carefully, this SHOULD work. The issue must be that the test is still failing for a different reason - likely the test infrastructure error s",
