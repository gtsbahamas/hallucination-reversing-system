The `__len__` method implementation is fine. The test failure is due to a Docker image build error, not a code issue. The error message shows:\n```\nError building image scikit-learn__scikit-learn-13439: 404 Client Error ... No such image\n```\n\nThis is an infrastructure/environment issue, not a problem with the code change.\n\n**The patch is correct because:**\n1. It implements `__len__` to return `len(self.steps)`, which is exactly what's needed\n2. This allows `len(pipe)` to work, which enables `pipe[:len(pipe)]` to function\n3. The implementation is simple and follows Python conventions\n4. It's consistent with the Pipeline's internal structure where `self.steps` is a list\n\n**Key insights:**\n- The issue asks for `__len__` to be implemented so that `pipe[:len(pipe)]` works\n- The Pipeline class stores step",
