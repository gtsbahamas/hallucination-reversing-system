      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the key problems:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Incorrect velocity calculation formula**: The patch uses `vel_vec + pos_vec.dt(frame)` which is wrong. If point `current_point` has velocity `v` in frame `N`, and `self` is at position `r` from `current_point`, then the velocity of `self` should be `v + dr/dt`, not `v + r.dt()`. The time derivative should be taken of the position vector alone.\n\n2. **Wrong approach**: The patch tries to find ANY point with velocity defined and then calculate from there. But this doesn't account for the proper velocity relationship between points. The correct formula should be based on the 2-point theory: `^N v^P = ^N v^O + d/dt(r^OP)` where `r^OP` is the position vector from O to P.\n\n3. **Doesn't handle the simplest case**: The issue example shows `Q.set_pos(P, r)` where `P` has no velocity defined. The patch would fail here because it searches for a point with velocity defined, but `",
