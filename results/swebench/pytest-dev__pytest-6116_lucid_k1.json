      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe patch added `--co` as a shortcut in the correct location, but the test failure indicates a Docker image build error, not a test logic failure. However, examining the code more carefully, there's a subtle issue with the option definition.\n\n**The actual issue:**\nIn the `group.addoption()` call, the options are defined with a trailing comma after the closing parenthesis:\n```python\ngroup.addoption(\n    \"--collectonly\",\n    \"--co\",\n    \"--collect-only\",\n    action=\"store_true\",\n    help=\"only collect tests, don't execute them.\",\n),  # <-- This trailing comma makes it a tuple!\n```\n\nThis trailing comma causes the entire `addoption()` call to be wrapped in a tuple, which is syntactically valid Python but semantically wrong. The method call returns `None`, so this creates a tuple `(None,)` which doesn't cause an immediate error but could lead",
