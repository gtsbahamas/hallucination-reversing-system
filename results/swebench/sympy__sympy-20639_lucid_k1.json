      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the key problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Overly complex logic**: The patch added multiple conditional branches trying to handle various cases of `exp(-1)` and rational exponents, but it didn't address the root cause.\n\n2. **Misunderstanding the problem**: The issue is that `1/E` becomes `exp(-1)`, which has `args = (-1,)` and is NOT a `Rational`. The current code checks `e.exp.is_Rational`, which fails for `exp(-1)`.\n\n3. **Incomplete handling**: The patch tried to detect `e.exp.is_Pow and e.exp.base is S.Exp1`, but this is checking if the exponent itself is a power of E, which is the right idea but implemented incorrectly.\n\n4. **The real issue**: Looking at line 1814 in the original code, when `e.exp` is `exp(-1)`, it's not a Rational, so it skips the root notation block entirely. But somewhere else in the code, it's being rendered as a root with `str()` being used on the exponent, whi",
