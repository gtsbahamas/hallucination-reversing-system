However, I can analyze the previous patch and identify the issues based on the code structure and test requirements.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Incorrect condition check**: The patch checks `if settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS:` which evaluates to `True` for a non-empty list, but `False` for an empty list. However, the issue description and hints suggest we should check if DATABASE_ROUTERS is **non-empty**, meaning it has actual routers configured.\n\n2. **Missing import**: The patch imports `Warning` but the actual Django checks module uses `Warning` from `django.core.checks`, which should already be available.\n\n3. **Logic placement**: The condition should check for non-empty DATABASE_ROUTERS (i.e., `len(settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS) > 0` or simply `settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS`), but we need to ensure it's checking for actual content, not just exist",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe patch has a critical logic error in the indentation/structure. After the `if getattr(settings, 'DATABASE_ROUTERS', []):` block, there's an `else:` clause that creates an Error, but this else is incorrectly indented - it should be at the same level as the `if` checking for DATABASE_ROUTERS, but the closing parenthesis and subsequent code structure is malformed.\n\nLooking at the diff more carefully:\n```python\nif getattr(settings, 'DATABASE_ROUTERS', []):\n    errors.append(\n        Warning(...)\n    )\nelse:\n    errors.append(\n        Error(...)\n    )\n```\n\nBut the original code structure shows the Error append was inside a single block. The patch tried to wrap it in an if/else but the indentation got messed up - notice the closing `)` after the Warning block, then another `errors.append(` for the Error, then another closing `)` at the end.
