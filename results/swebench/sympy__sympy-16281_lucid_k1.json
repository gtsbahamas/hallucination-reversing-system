      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can see several problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incomplete implementation**: The patch tried to build the product symbol but didn't properly integrate with the existing `prettyForm` API\n2. **String manipulation errors**: Attempted to use `str(prettyUpper)` and direct string concatenation which doesn't work with `prettyForm` objects\n3. **Baseline calculation issues**: The baseline wasn't properly set for vertical alignment\n4. **Missing proper integration**: Didn't follow the pattern used by `_print_Sum` for building the symbol\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n\n1. The main complaint is the **empty line at the bottom** of the \u220f symbol - this makes it asymmetric\n2. The \u220f is **too wide** - needs to be more compact\n3. The current implementation likely adds an extra vertical bar line at the bottom that serves no purpose\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nBased on examining similar code (like `_print_Sum` and `_prin",
