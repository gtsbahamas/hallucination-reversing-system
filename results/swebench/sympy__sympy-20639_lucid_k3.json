      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the key problems:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incomplete logic flow**: The patch added a check for `e.is_Pow and len(e.args) == 1` but then just used `pass`, which doesn't prevent the code from falling through to problematic sections below.\n\n2. **Incorrect understanding of the bug**: The issue states that `(1/E).args = (-1,)` while `(1/pi).args = (pi, -1)`. The expression `1/E` is actually `exp(-1)`, which is a `Pow` object with base `E` and exponent `-1`. It's not about `len(e.args) == 1`.\n\n3. **Missing the actual problematic code**: Looking at line 1814 mentioned in the hints, the real issue is likely in code that uses `str()` to check the exponent, which doesn't work correctly for expressions like `exp(-1)`.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test infrastructure failed to build, but based on the issue description:\n- `pi**(1/E)` renders incorrectly as `-1___\\n\u2572\u2571 \u03c0` \n- This sugges",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify several problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n1. **Incomplete logic flow**: The patch added a check for `e.func.__name__ == 'exp'` but then just used `pass`, leaving the code to fall through without handling the case properly.\n\n2. **Broken control flow**: The patch restructured the radical notation logic but left it incomplete. After the `if self._settings['root_notation']:` block, there's a dangling condition that tries to handle non-radical cases, but the logic is malformed.\n\n3. **Missing code**: The original code after the radical notation section was removed but not properly replaced, causing the function to be incomplete.\n\n4. **Wrong approach to detection**: Using `e.func.__name__ == 'exp'` is fragile. The real issue (as noted in the hints) is that `1/E` becomes `exp(-1)` which has `args = (-1,)`, while `1/pi` has `args = (pi, -1)`. The structure is fundamentally different.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue is that `pi",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and the error, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n1. **Wrong condition check**: The patch only checks `e.is_Rational and e.p == 1 and e.q != 1`, but the issue is with `pi**(1/E)` where `1/E = exp(-1)`. This has `args = (-1,)` - it's NOT a Rational, it's an `exp` object.\n\n2. **Misunderstanding the problem**: The bug occurs because the code uses `str(e.q)` to get the radical index, but when the exponent is `exp(-1)` (which is `1/E`), there's no `.q` attribute. The current code path shouldn't even be reached for `1/E`.\n\n3. **The real issue**: Looking at line 1814 in the hints, the problem is that the code tries to handle expressions like `pi**(1/x)` by checking if the exponent looks like `1/something`, but it uses string comparison which fails for complex expressions.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nFrom the hints:\n- `(1/E).args = (-1,)` - it's an `exp` object, not a `Pow` with base and exponent\n- `(1/pi).args = (pi, -1)` - this IS a ",
