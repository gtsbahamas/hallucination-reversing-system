This is wrong because:\n- When `TypeError` is raised (e.g., trying to add an unhashable list to a set), `s` is already the problematic element\n- But we're in the middle of processing it, and the exception occurred during `s in seen`\n- We should yield `s` and continue with remaining elements, not re-yield the same `s`\n\n### 2. **Incorrect Length Check Placement**\nThe length check happens **after** getting the element:\n```python\nfor i, s in enumerate(seq):\n    if has_len and len(seq) != original_len:\n        raise RuntimeError(...)\n```\n\nT",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify several problems:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Iterator consumption issue**: The patch uses `for s in seq:` which consumes the iterator, but then in the `except TypeError` block, it tries to iterate over `seq` again with `for s in uniq(seq, result):`. Once an iterator is consumed, you can't iterate over it again.\n\n2. **Variable scope problem**: The variable `i` is used in the exception handler (`seq[i + 1:]`), but when using `for s in seq:` instead of `enumerate`, the `i` counter is incremented manually and may not be in sync with where the TypeError actually occurred.\n\n3. **Logic error in exception handling**: The exception handler has two branches - one for `__getitem__` and one for non-indexable iterables. The non-indexable branch tries to call `uniq(seq, result)` again, but `seq` is already exhausted if it's an iterator.\n\n4. **The actual test failure**: The test infrastructure failed to build the Docker image",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect placement of length check**: The patch checks `len(seq) != original_len` inside the `except TypeError` block, but by that point, we've already moved past the element that caused the TypeError. The length check happens too late.\n\n2. **Wrong logic flow**: The TypeError exception is caught when an unhashable element is encountered (can't be added to the `seen` set), not when the sequence is modified. The patch conflates these two different scenarios.\n\n3. **Missing continuous monitoring**: The patch only checks the length once after a TypeError, but modifications could happen at any point during iteration. We need to check the length on every iteration.\n\n4. **Variable scope issue**: The variable `s` referenced in the except block is the last value from the for loop, which may not be the right context for the unhashable element handling.\n\n## Fix Plan\n",
