      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe previous patch attempted to add a `_print_sinc` method to handle the `sinc` function, but the test failed due to an infrastructure error (Docker image not found), not a code issue. However, examining the patch more carefully reveals a potential problem:\n\n**The patch imports are inside the method**, which is inefficient and non-standard for the codebase. More importantly, the method name `_print_sinc` doesn't match the expected pattern for how SymPy's printing system works.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Function naming convention**: Looking at the existing code, special functions are handled via the `known_functions` dictionary or through `_print_FunctionName` methods where `FunctionName` matches the SymPy class name.\n\n2. **The sinc function**: In SymPy, `sinc` is likely a function class. The printer needs to recognize it and convert it to the Piecewise form.\n\n3. **Import location**: The imp",
