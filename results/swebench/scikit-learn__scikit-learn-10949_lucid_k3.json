The patch attempted to store DataFrame dtypes as a tuple before conversion\n2. It tried to compare this tuple of dtypes against the final array dtype\n3. The error indicates the Docker image wasn't built/found, but more importantly, the logic has a fundamental flaw\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1. **Incorrect dtype comparison**: When a DataFrame with `dtype=object` is converted to a numpy array, all columns get converted to a single dtype (e.g., `float64`). The patch stores `dtypes_orig` as a tuple of column dtypes, but then compares individual elements of this tuple against `array.dtype`. This doesn't properly detect the conversion.\n\n2. **Wrong dtype capture point**: The patch captures dtypes before `np.asarray()` conversion, but the actual dtype that should be compared is the dtype of the DataFrame as a whole when it's treated as an array-like object, not individual column dtype",

At this point, `array` already has the converted dtype, so we're comparing the converted dtype against itself.\n\n2. **Incorrect location**: The dtype capture happens after line 437 where `array = np.asarray(array, dtype=dtype, order=order)` has already performed the conversion.
