      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I can see what went wrong with the previous patch and what needs to be fixed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n**The Issue:**\nWhen SQLite remakes a table (during `ALTER FIELD`), it needs to recreate constraints. For `UniqueConstraint` with expressions (like `F('name')`), the code generates SQL with table-qualified column references (e.g., `\"old_table\".\"name\"`). SQLite doesn't allow the dot operator in index expressions, causing the error: `\"the \".\" operator prohibited in index expressions\"`.\n\n**What the Previous Patch Did Wrong:**\nThe previous patch only checked if `col.alias == old_table` before updating it to `new_table`. However, this doesn't solve the core problem. The issue is that when `col.alias` is set to a table name, it causes the SQL generation to include the table qualifier (the dot operator), which SQLite rejects.\n\n**Key Insight from Test Requirements:**\nThe test `test_rename_table_references_without_alias` suggests that when a `Col` doesn't have an alia",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch added logic to only update `col.alias` when it equals `old_table`, but it **always appends to `self.columns`** inside the loop. This is incorrect because:\n\n1. The original code had `self.columns = []` initialization but never populated it in the loop\n2. The patch added `self.columns.append(col.target.column)` inside the loop, which means columns get appended during the alias update phase\n3. This breaks the separation of concerns - the method should update aliases in expressions, but `self.columns` should be populated from the updated expressions, not during the update\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\nLooking at the `__init__` method:\n```python\ncolumns = [col.target.column for col in self.compiler.query._gen_cols([self.expressions])]\n```\n\nThe `self.columns` list should be derived from `self.expressions` **after** they've been updated, ",

This creates a race condition where columns might be updated twice or incorrectly.\n\n2. **Logic flaw**: The condition `if col.alias == old_table` assumes that columns with an explicit alias set to `old_table` should be updated. However, the real issue is that when `col.alias` is `None` (not set), we shouldn't be setting it at all. The error \"the '.' operator prohibited in index expressions\" occurs because we're adding table prefixes where they shouldn't exist.\n\n3. **Missing the root cause**: The test name `test_rename_table_references_without_alias` is a huge hint - we need to handle columns that DON'T have an alias set, not just check if the alias matches th",
