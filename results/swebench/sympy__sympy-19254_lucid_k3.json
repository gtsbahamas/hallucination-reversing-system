The patch correctly removed `sqrt(n+1)` but needs to ensure the L2 norm is computed correctly.\n\n3. **Multivariate case complexity**: The recursive function `_rec_l2_norm_squared` is defined inside the function, which could cause issues with scope and efficiency.\n\n4. **Type handling**: The code doesn't properly handle the domain arithmetic - `K(cf)**2` might not work correctly for all coefficient types.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n### For `dup_zz_mignotte_bound`:\n1.
