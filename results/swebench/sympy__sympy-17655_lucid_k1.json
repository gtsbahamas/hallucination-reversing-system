      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch correctly added `__rmul__` to handle left multiplication (e.g., `2.0 * point2`), but the test infrastructure failed due to a Docker image issue, not because of the code itself. The patch implementation looks correct.\n\nHowever, let me verify the logic:\n\n1. The issue shows that `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works (calls `__mul__`)\n2. But `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` fails (needs `__rmul__`)\n3. The previous patch added `__rmul__` with the same implementation as `__mul__`\n\n## Key Insights\n\nThe implementation is actually correct. When Python evaluates `scalar * point`:\n1. It first tries `scalar.__mul__(point)`\n2. If that returns `NotImplemented` or fails, it tries `point.__rmul__(scalar)`\n\nThe `__rmul__` method should handle the scalar on the left side, which the previous patch does correctly by:\n- Taking the `factor` parameter (the lef",
