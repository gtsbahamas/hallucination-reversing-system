The issue is:\n\n1. When `n_init > 1`, the loop runs multiple initializations\n2. After the loop completes, `best_params` contains the parameters from the best initialization\n3. However, the model's current state may be from the LAST initialization (which might not be the best one)\n4. The previous patch calls `_e_step(X)` AFTER restoring `best_params`, which is correct\n5. **BUT** the patch removed the indentation/placement incorrectly - the final `_e_step` needs to happen after `_set_parameters(best_params)` is called\n\nLooking more carefully at the diff, the issue is that the final `_e_step()` was moved outside the loop but the logic flow is broken. The problem is:\n\n- The loop ends, and we have `best_params` stored\n- We need to call `_s",
