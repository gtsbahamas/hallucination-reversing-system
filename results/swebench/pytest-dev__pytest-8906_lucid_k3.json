The patch changed:\n\n```python\n\"Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\"\n```\n\nto:\n\n```python\n\"Using pytest.skip outside of a test will skip the entire module. \"\n\"If that's your intention, pass `allow_module_level=True`. If you want to \"\n\"skip a specific test or an entire class, use the @pytest.mark.skip or \"\n\"@pytest.mark.skipif decorators.\"\n```\n\nHowever, the test is failing because it expects the old message format.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Update the test expectation** in `testing/test_skipping.py::test_module_level",
