However, this is too strict and happens too late in the process.\n\n**Key problems:**\n\n1. **Timing Issue**: The check occurs in `as_sql()`, which is called during query compilation. By this point, `self.rhs` may have already been processed/transformed by `get_prep_lookup()` in the `__init__` method.\n\n2. **Expression Handling**: The check doesn't account for expressions like `F()` objects or other query expressions that need to be resolved first. When someone passes `F('boolean_field')`, it's a valid expression that should be allowed, but `isinstance(F('boolean_field'), bool)` returns `False`.\n\n3. **Prepared Values**: Since `prepare_rhs = False` for `IsNull`, the `self.rhs` should remain as-is, but we need to validate it's a",

But it fails to handle cases where `self.rhs` might be an expression (like `F()` objects) that should be allowed through\n3. The test infrastructure error suggests the patch wasn't even tested properly\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1. **The check is in the wrong place conceptually** - It checks `rhs_is_direct_value()` but doesn't properly handle all non-direct values (expressions, subqueries, etc.)\n\n2. **The isinstance check is correct but incomplete** - We need to ensure we're only validating direct boolean values, not expressions that will be evaluated later\n\n3. **Missing edge cases:**\n   - `F()` expressions ",
