When a `Product` with a CharField primary key is created without the PK set initially\n2. Then assigned to an `Order` \n3. Then the PK is set on the `Product`\n4. When both are saved, the `Order.product_id` ends up as an empty string instead of \"foo\"\n\nThe root cause is in `_prepare_related_fields_for_save()` - when checking if we should use the related object's PK, it only checks `if getattr(self, field.attname) is None`, but for CharField fields, the default value is `\"\"` (empty string), not `None`.\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix this by changing:\n```python\nelif getattr(self, field.attname) is None:\n```\nto:\n```python\nelif getattr(self, field.attname) in field.empty_values:\n```\n\nHowever, **the test infrastructure failed to build the Docker image**, s",
