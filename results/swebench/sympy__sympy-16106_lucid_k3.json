      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect handling of `IndexedBase`**: The patch added a `_print_IndexedBase` method, but `IndexedBase` objects should not be printed directly in isolation. When you have `IndexedBase(a)[b]`, this creates an `Indexed` object, not an `IndexedBase` object.\n\n2. **The issue description is misleading**: The error occurs with `sympy.IndexedBase(a)[b]`, which creates an `Indexed` object (not `IndexedBase`). The `Indexed` class represents a subscripted variable.\n\n3. **Wrong structure**: The patch tried to print `IndexedBase` separately, but what's needed is to handle `Indexed` objects properly. An `Indexed` object has:\n   - `e.base`: The base (which is an `IndexedBase`)\n   - `e.indices`: A tuple of indices\n\n4. **Test failure reason**: The Docker image build failed (404 error), so we don't have actual test output.

However, examining the patch reveals a conceptual issue:\n\n### What Was Wrong with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Incorrect attribute access**: The patch uses `e.base.label` to access the base symbol, but `Indexed` objects have a `base` attribute that is an `IndexedBase` object, and `IndexedBase` has a `label` attribute. This is correct structurally.\n\n2. **Missing proper handling**: Looking at the issue description and hints, the current output shows it's falling back to `_print_Basic`, which iterates over the expression. The patch correctly adds `_print_Indexed` methods to prevent this.\n\n3. **The actual issue**: The patch looks structurally sound for basic cases, but we need to verify:\n   - Whether `e.base.label` is the right way to access the symbol\n   - Whether the MathM",

But we need to verify it handles both:\n   - Simple case: `IndexedBase(a)[b]` \u2192 should render as `a_b` (subscript)\n   - The base object itself: `IndexedBase(a)` \u2192 should render as just `a`\n\n3. **Missing `_print_IndexedBase` method**: The hints explicitly state \"a method `",
