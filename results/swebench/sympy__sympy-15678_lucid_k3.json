When `y = f(x)`, calling `y.name` fails because `AppliedUndef` objects don't have a `.name` attribute like `Symbol` does.\n\n2. **The derivative creation logic assumes `y` is a Symbol**: The line `dydx = Function(y.name)(x).diff(x)` assumes `y` has a `.name` attribute, which works for `Symbol` but not for `AppliedUndef`.\n\n3. **The function substitution dictionary logic is flawed**: The line `f = dict([(s, Function(s.name)(x)) for s in eq.free_symbols if s != x and s in dep])` tries to convert symbols to functions, but when `y` is already a function like `f(x)`, this doesn't work correctly.\n\n### Key Insights from Test Requirements:\n\nFr",

The substitution dictionary `f` is built incorrectly.\n\n2. **The substitution logic is broken**: When `y` is `f(x)`, the code sets `f = {y: y}`, which means no substitution happens. But the equation still contains `f(x)` which needs to be treated as the dependent variable.\n\n3. **Missing handling in the loop**: The `derivs` dictionary and subsequent iterations don't properly track derivatives of `AppliedUndef` objects.\n\n4. **The `Eq` handling is correct** but the rest of the logic breaks for function arguments.\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFrom the test cases:\n- `idiff(Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x)), y, x)` should work (Eq support)\n- `idiff(f(x)*exp(f(x)) - ",

When `y = f(x)`, the code sets `f = {}` (empty dict), then does `eq.subs(f)` which does nothing, leaving the equation unchanged.\n\n### Problem 2: Missing Handling in Loop\nThe derivative loop still references `dydx` which may not be properly defined for `AppliedUndef` cases, and the substitution logic doesn't account for higher-order derivatives of functions.\n\n### Problem 3: Incomplete Eq Handling  \nWhile the patch converts `Eq` to an expression, it doesn't ensure the result is properly handled when `solve()` returns an empty list (the original IndexError issue).\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **For `Eq` support**: Keep the conversion `eq.lhs - eq.rhs` at the start\n\n2. **For `f(x)` support**: \n   - When `y` is `AppliedUndef` (like `f(x)`), don't c",
