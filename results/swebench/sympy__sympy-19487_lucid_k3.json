But there's a conceptual problem: **the rewrite always returns a Piecewise**, even when it's not necessary.\n\n### Key Insights from the Discussion\n\n1. The issue mentions that if a rewrite cannot be fulfilled under all conditions and the request is not for Piecewise, the rewrite should return `None` (not rewrite at all)\n\n2. For simple cases like `sign(1+I)`, the rewrite should work directly without Piecewise since we know it's non-zero\n\n3. The rewrite should only use Piecewise when:\n   - The argument could potentially be zero\n   - We can't determine if it's zero or not\n\n4.

However, this approach is too conservative and fails for common cases.\n\n**Key Problem:**\n\nWhen `arg.is_zero` is `None` (uncertain), the method returns `None`, which means the rewrite fails. This happens for most symbolic expressions like `sign(x)` or `sign(1+I)` where we cannot statically determine if they're zero.\n\n**Test Failure:**\n\nThe test infrastructure error aside, the logic issue is that the rewrite should work for cases where we have symbolic expressions that are unlikely to be zero (like `1+I` from the issue description), but the patch is too restrictive.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nBased on the hints in the issue:\n\n1. **Don't return `None` for uncertain cases** - Instead, use `Piecewise` to handle the zero case exp",
