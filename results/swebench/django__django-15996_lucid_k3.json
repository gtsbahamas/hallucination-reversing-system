However, accessing `.name` on a combined flag might raise an `AttributeError` rather than return `None`.\n\n2. **Missing error handling**: The code doesn't handle the case where accessing `.name` might fail for combined flags.\n\n3. **Potential issue with `enum._decompose`**: The `_decompose` function is a private API and its signature/behavior might vary. The patch uses `enum._decompose(enum_class, self.value)` which should work, but we need to ensure it's called correctly.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe corrected approach should:\n\n1. **Use try-except for name access**: Wrap the ",
