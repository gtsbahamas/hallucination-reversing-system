      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue description, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect comparison logic**: The patch compares `self.verbose_name != model_verbose_name` to determine if a custom verbose_name was set. However, this comparison happens AFTER `self.verbose_name` has already been set to `model_verbose_name` when it was `None`. So the comparison will always be `False` when `verbose_name` wasn't explicitly set on the inline.\n\n2. **Naive pluralization**: Using `format_lazy('{}s', self.verbose_name)` is too simplistic. Django has proper pluralization utilities that should be used instead.\n\n3. **Logic flow issue**: The code stores `model_verbose_name` but then immediately overwrites `self.verbose_name` if it's `None`, making the comparison meaningless.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Requirements\n\nThe test `test_verbose_name_inline` expects that when an inline class explicitly sets `verbose_name`, the `verbose_name_plura",
