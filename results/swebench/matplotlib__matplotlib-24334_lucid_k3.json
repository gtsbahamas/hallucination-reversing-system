However, examining the logic more carefully, there's a fundamental issue with the approach:\n\nThe patch checks `if kwargs and labels is None`, but this happens **before** `_set_tick_locations` is called. The problem is that `kwargs` might contain valid parameters that should be passed through even when `labels` is not set (though according to the issue, we want to prevent this).\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n1. The issue states that kwargs like `xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"]` in `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"])` are silently ignored\n2. The proposed solution is to make any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set\n3. The current code only applies kwargs when labels are provided: `if labels is not None: self.set",

However, I can analyze the previous patch and identify the issues based on the code structure and the requirements.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch added validation in `Axis.set_ticks()` to raise a `TypeError` when kwargs are provided without labels. However, there are several issues:\n\n1. **Placement Issue**: The check happens too early, before `_set_tick_locations()` is called. This could cause issues if the validation itself has problems.\n\n2. **Error Message**: While descriptive, the error message could be more concise.\n\n3. **Missing Test Coverage**: The test `test_set_ticks_kwargs_raise_error_without_labels` likely expects a specific error type and message format.\n\n4. **Incomplete Solution**: The patch only addresses `Axis.set_ticks()`, but the issue mentions `Axes.set_xticks` as well. We need to ensure both paths are covered.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n##",
