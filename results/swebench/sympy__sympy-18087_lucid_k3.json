      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch only checked `factor.exp.is_Integer` for the outer power, but this is insufficient\n2. The real issue is that `Factors` stores `sin(x)**2` with exponent `1/2` (from `sqrt`), creating `{sin(x)**2: 1/2}`\n3. When reconstructing, it tries to do `(sin(x)**2)**(1/2)` which should stay as `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`, not simplify to `sin(x)`\n4. The patch's logic for handling non-integer exponents was incomplete - it didn't prevent the multiplication of exponents in the problematic case\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nThe problem occurs in line 1901 of `fu.py` where `Factors({sin(x)**2: S.Half}).as_expr()` incorrectly returns `sin(x)` instead of `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`.\n\nThe root cause: When `factor = sin(x)**2` and `exponent = 1/2`, the code does:\n```python\nbase, exp = factor.as_base_exp()  # base=sin(x), exp=2\nexponent *= exp  # exponent = 1/2 * 2 = 1\nargs.appe",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch added logic to check if exponent multiplication is valid, but it has **indentation errors** - the entire block is indented at the same level as the `if isinstance(factor, Pow):` check, making the `else` clause ambiguous\n2. The logic structure is broken - after the nested power handling, it always appends `Pow(base, exponent)` or `Pow(factor, exponent)`, but then there's a dangling `else: args.append(Pow(factor, exponent))` that would never execute properly\n3. The test failure shows a Docker image build error, but this is likely masking the real issue which would be a syntax/indentation error\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFrom the issue description:\n- `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is being incorrectly simplified to `sin(x)` for complex `x`\n- This happens in `Factors.as_expr()` when it reconstructs `sin(x)**2` with exponent `1/2`\n- The problem: `(sin(x)**2)**(1/2)`",
