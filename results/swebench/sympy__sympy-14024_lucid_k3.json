However, I can analyze what's wrong with the previous patch based on the code logic.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch tried to return `None` from `Integer._eval_power` when we have a negative integer base with a non-integer rational exponent. The problem is:\n\n1. **Wrong return value**: Returning `None` from `_eval_power` doesn't prevent evaluation - it just signals that this method couldn't handle it, and the evaluation continues elsewhere.\n\n2. **The real issue**: The problem occurs in `Rational._eval_power`, not just `Integer._eval_power`. When we have `(-2)**(-10/3)`, the base `-2` is an `Integer`, but the evaluation logic in `Rational._eval_power` (which `Integer` inherits) is doing:\n   ```python\n   return Rational.__new__(cls, self.p**other.p, other.q**self.p)\n   ```\n   This computes `(-2)**(-10) / 3**(-2)` which is mathematically correc",

However, returning `None` doesn't prevent evaluation - it just signals that this method can't handle it, and the evaluation continues elsewhere in the code, likely still producing the incorrect result.\n\n**The real problem:**\nThe issue is in how `(-2)**(-S(10)/3)` gets automatically simplified. When we have a negative integer base raised to a rational power, the code path is:\n1. `Integer.__pow__` gets called with base=-2, exponent=-10/3\n2. Currently it evaluates to `Rational(-2**10, 3**(-2))` which simplifies incorrectly\n3.

The patch returns `None` (implicitly via bare `return`) when encountering a negative integer base with a rational exponent\n2. Returning `None` from `__pow__` doesn't prevent evaluation - it just signals that this method can't handle it, and Python/SymPy will try other approaches\n3. The issue is that the automatic evaluation still happens elsewhere in the code, leading to incorrect simplification\n\n**The Real Problem:**\nThe issue states that `(-2)**(-S(10)/3)` evaluates to `-(-2)**(2/3)/16` which has the wrong complex argument. The problem is in how `Pow.eval()` or related code handles negative integer bases with rational exponents - it's incorrectly simplifying them.\n\n## Key Insights from Issue\n\n1. `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` where `a` is a positive integer symbol correctly simplifies to `(-1)**x`\n2. `(-2)**x * 2**(-x)` where `2` is a concrete integer incorr",
