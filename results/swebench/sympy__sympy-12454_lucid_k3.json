This is problematic because:\n   - When `i + 1 >= self.cols`, we get `range(self.cols, self.cols)` which is empty - correct behavior\n   - But when `i + 1 < self.cols`, we get `range(i + 1, self.cols)` - same as before\n   - The real issue is that `min(i + 1, self.cols)` doesn't prevent the problem; it just moves where it occurs\n\n### The actual issue with `is_lower()`:\n\nFor a tall matrix (e.g., 4x2), `is_lower()` should check elements **above** the diagonal.

The hint in the issue explicitly mentions checking if `is_lower()` has a similar issue.\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nFor a matrix to be **upper triangular**, all entries below the main diagonal must be zero. For a 4\u00d72 matrix:\n```\n[a b]\n[0 b]  <- entries below diagonal (row 1, col 0)\n[0 0]  <- entries below diagonal (row 2, col 0-1)\n[0 0]  <- entries below diagonal (row 3, col 0-1)\n```\n\nThe iteration `for j in range(i)` tries to access column indices 0, 1, 2 when `i=3`, but a 4\u00d72 matrix only has columns 0 and 1, causing the IndexError at `(3, 2)`.\n\nFor **lower triangular**, the symmet",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the IndexError by using `min(i, self.cols)` and `min(j, self.rows)` to prevent out-of-bounds access. However, this approach has a **fundamental logical flaw**.\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nFor `is_upper()`:\n- Original: `for j in range(i)` \n- Patched: `for j in range(min(i, self.cols))`\n\nThe problem: When `i >= self.cols`, this changes the iteration range from `range(i)` to `range(self.cols)`, which means we're checking **fewer** elements than we should. This breaks the correctness of the upper triangular check.\n\nFor example, with a 4\u00d72 matrix:\n- Row 3 (i=3): Should check columns 0, 1 (below diagonal)\n- Patched version: Checks columns 0, 1 (correct by accident)\n- But row 2 (i=2): Should check columns 0, 1\n- Patched version: Also checks columns 0, 1 (correct)\n\nWait, let me reconsider...\n\nActually, the issue is more subtle.
