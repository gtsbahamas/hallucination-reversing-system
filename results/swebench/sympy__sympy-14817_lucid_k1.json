      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch used `_coeff_isneg(item)` to check if a matrix term is negative. However, `_coeff_isneg` is designed for scalar expressions and expects the argument to have a coefficient that can be extracted and checked. Matrix expressions don't work the same way - a `MatrixSymbol` or matrix expression doesn't have a simple scalar coefficient that can be checked with `_coeff_isneg`.\n\n**The core issue:**\nThe original code tried to use `S(item.args[0]).is_negative` which:\n1. Assumed `item.args[0]` exists and is a string/number\n2. Used `sympify` on it, which fails for strings like `'y*'` (invalid Python syntax)\n\nThe fix attempted to use `_coeff_isneg(item)` but this doesn't work for matrix expressions either.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Key insight from `_print_Add`:**\nLooking at how `_print_Add` handles this (which the hints suggest we should follow), it doesn't",
