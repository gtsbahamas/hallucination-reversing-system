However, analyzing the patch reveals a critical issue:\n\n### Problem with Previous Patch\n\nThe patch uses `np.searchsorted(boundaries, data)` which finds where `data` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. However, this doesn't correctly identify which boundary interval the data falls into for `BoundaryNorm`.\n\n**Key Issue**: `searchsorted` returns the index where `data` would be inserted, but for `BoundaryNorm`:\n- If `data = 1.5` and `boundaries = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, `searchsorted` returns `2`\n- But we need the interval `[1, 2]` which are indices `1` and `2` in boundaries\n- The patch tries to use `boundaries[idx-1]` and `boundaries[idx]`, which would give `[1, 2]` - this seems correct\n\n**However**, there's a subtle bug:\n- When `data` exactly equals a boundary value, the behavior is ambiguous\n- The patch doesn't handle edge cases properly (data outside bound",
