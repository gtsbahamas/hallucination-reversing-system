However, the test failure appears to be an infrastructure/Docker issue rather than a code issue - the error shows \"No such image\" which is unrelated to the actual code changes.\n\n**However, examining the code logic more carefully:**\n\nThe previous patch has the right approach but there's a subtle issue with how it's structured. The import statement `from django.core.serializers.json import DjangoJSONEncoder` is inside the function, which is fine, but the logic `encoder or DjangoJSONEncoder` means:\n- If `encoder=None` (default), it uses `DjangoJSONEncoder` \u2713\n- If a custom encoder is passed, it uses that encoder \u2713\n\nThis logic is actually correct!\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nSince the infrastructure error prevents us from seei",

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the issue is that the Docker image failed to build, which prevented the test from running. However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify potential issues.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch has the right approach but there's a subtle issue:\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe patch correctly adds the `encoder` parameter and uses it, but there's an unnecessary import statement that remains at the top of the function. The `DjangoJSONEncoder` is imported unconditionally even when a custom encoder is provided.\n\n**What needs to change:**\n1. Move the import inside the conditional block to avoid unnecessary imports when a custom encoder is provided\n2. The logic is correct but can be slightly optimized\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe patch is actually very close to correct. The main improvement would be to optimize the import:\n\n```python\ndef json_script(value, element_id=None, encoder=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Escape all the HTML/XML special characters with their unicode e",
