The patch logic itself was on the right track but had issues:\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Malformed diff syntax**: The patch has incorrect indentation markers (missing `-` and `+` prefixes on some lines) causing it to fail during application\n2. **Logic flow issue**: The code tries to handle the docstring check but the control flow is confusing with nested conditions\n3. **Redundant checks**: Checks `isinstance(doc, str)` multiple times unnecessarily\n\n### Root Cause from Test Output:\n\nThe issue occurs in `AssertionRewriter.run()` at line 695 where `is_rewrite_disabled()` is called. When the first expression in a file is a number (like `0`), `ast.get_docstring()` returns that number instead of `None` or a string. Then `is_rewrite_disabled()` tries to check `\"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring`, which fails because you can't use",
