      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to **malformed patch format**. The patch contained multiple attempts and explanatory text mixed with the actual diff, causing the patch parser to fail.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Patch format issue**: The diff contained multiple versions and explanatory comments within the patch block\n2. **Incorrect structure**: Had redundant code blocks and markdown formatting that broke the patch syntax\n3. **Line number mismatch**: The patch tried to apply at line 1773, but the actual location may differ\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe core logic was sound - we need to check if operands are matrices before allowing `@` operator. The fix should:\n\n1. **Clean patch format**: Provide a single, well-formed diff\n2. **Proper validation**: Check if `other` is a matrix-like object by verifying it has matrix attributes\n3. **Correct error message**: Match NumPy's error message format\n4. **Handle both directions**: Implement checks in both `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__`\n\n## Co",
