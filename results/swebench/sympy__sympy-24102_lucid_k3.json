Replacing `[a-zA-Z]` with `\\w` in regex patterns\n2. Adding `re.UNICODE` flag to regex compilations\n\n**Why it failed:** The test results show a Docker image build error, which suggests the patch may have introduced syntax issues or the test infrastructure failed. However, the more fundamental problem is:\n\n### Core Issue with `\\w` Approach\n\nThe `\\w` character class in Python regex:\n- **Without re.UNICODE in Python 2**: matches `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`\n- **With re.UNICODE**: matches Unicode word characters INCLUDING digits\n\nThis creates a critical problem: **`\\w` matches digits**, but the original patterns explicitly separated letter matching from digit matching for a reason - to control where multiplication operators are inserted.\n\nFor example, in the `'whitespace'` rule:\n- Original: `(?<=[a-zA-Z\\d])` - matche",

The patch added Unicode ranges for Greek characters (`\\u0370-\\u03FF\\u1F00-\\u1FFF`) to various regex patterns\n2. However, the test failed with a Docker image error, which suggests the patch may have syntax issues or the approach is incomplete\n3. More critically, the patch only modified the **old parser's regex patterns** in the `RULES` dictionary and related patterns, but the issue is with `parse_mathematica()` which uses a **different parsing path**\n\n**Key Insight from Code Structure:**\nThe `parse_mathematica()` function calls `parser.parse(s)`, which is NOT shown in the truncated code. The old `mathematica()` function calls `parser._parse_old(s)`. These are two different code paths:\n- Old path: `mathematica()` \u2192 `_parse_old()` \u2192 uses `RULES` regex patterns\n- New path: `parse_mathematica()` \u2192 `parse()` \u2192 likely uses a different tokenizer/par",
