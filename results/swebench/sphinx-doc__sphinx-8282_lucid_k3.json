      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch attempted to strip type hints from overload signatures by modifying the `Signature` object directly\n2. However, it tried to use `overload_sig.replace()` which doesn't exist on `Signature` objects - the correct method is `Signature.replace()`\n3. The approach of creating new `Parameter` objects with `p.replace()` is also incorrect - `Parameter` objects need to be created properly\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\n- The test failed due to a Docker image issue, but the code itself has a fundamental problem\n- The `Signature` class doesn't have a `replace()` method that can be called on instances\n- We need to reconstruct the signature properly without type hints\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Check the `autodoc_typehints` setting before stringifying the signature**, not after evaluating it\n2. **Pass the configuration to `s",

The `kwargs` dictionary is created later in the code when calling `stringify_signature()`.\n\n2. **Incorrect variable scope**: The patch modifies `kwargs` inside a conditional block that only executes when `self.analyzer` exists and has overloads, but this doesn't affect the actual signature generation.\n\n3. **Missing the actual signature generation call**: The patch doesn't modify where `stringify_signature()` is actually called for overloads.
