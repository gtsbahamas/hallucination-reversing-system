However, this doesn't address the root cause.\n\n2. **The real problem**: When `zs` is passed as a column vector (shape `(n, 1)`) instead of a 1D array (shape `(n,)`), `np.broadcast_to()` fails because it can't broadcast a 2D array to match the length of a 1D array.\n\n3. **Missing initialization**: The original issue shows that `_verts3d` is never set when the first exception occurs, leading to the `AttributeError` on subsequent draws.\n\n4. **Test failure**: The test `test_draw_single_lines_from_Nx1` specifically tests the case where inputs are `(N, 1)` shaped arrays, which is exactly what's failing.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test name `test_draw_single_lines_from_Nx1` tells us the",
