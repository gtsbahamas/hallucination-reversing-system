      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I can see what went wrong with the previous patch and what needs to be fixed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n**The Issue:**\nThe code needs to handle `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` where the argument `second/(farad*ohm)` is dimensionless (it simplifies to `time/(capacitance*impedance)` which equals `1` dimensionally). The function should recognize this and allow it.\n\n**What Was Wrong with the Previous Patch:**\n\nThe previous patch checked if arguments to functions are dimensionless and raised an error if they weren't. However, it had a critical flaw:\n\n```python\nreturn expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), Dimension(1)\n```\n\nThis line returns a **tuple with only 2 elements** `(factor, dimension)`, but the unpacking syntax `*(d[1] for d in fds)` in the original code was trying to return **multiple dimensions** as separate return values, which is incorrect Python syntax anyway.\n\nLooking at the original code more carefully:\n```python\nreturn (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)),\n       ",
