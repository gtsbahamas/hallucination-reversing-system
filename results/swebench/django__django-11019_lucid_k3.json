This creates a reverse topological order (dependencies come before dependents in the result), which is correct. However, the sorting of dependencies by `all_items.index(x)` doesn't preserve the original order properly.\n\n2. **Path tracking issue**: The `path` parameter is used for cycle detection, but `new_path = path + [item]` creates a new list each time, which is correct. However, the cycle detection logic checks `if item in visiting` but the path might not accurately reflect the current visiting stack.\n\n3. **Missing deduplication in single list case**: When there's only one list, the code returns `list(lists[0])` without deduplicating, which violates the requirement from #12879.\n\n4. **CSS merging still uses ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the key problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incorrect Dependency Direction**: The patch builds dependencies backwards. It adds `prev_item` as a dependency of `item`, meaning \"prev_item must come before item\". However, in the topological sort, it visits dependencies first, which would place them *after* the current item in the result.\n\n2. **Result Order is Reversed**: The topological sort appends items to `result` after visiting their dependencies, which produces a reversed order. Items should be prepended or the final result should be reversed.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection Logic**: The cycle detection warns about cycles but doesn't handle them properly - it just returns without adding the item to the result, which can lead to missing items.\n\n4. **Sorting Dependencies**: The line `deps = sorted(dependency_graph.get(item, []), key=lambda x: all_items.index(x))` tries to maintain order but doesn",
