      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the key problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect filtering logic**: The patch filters out members that are in `cls.__dict__.values()`, but this is backwards. When we want to \"ignore\" a base class (e.g., `object`), we want to **exclude members that come from that class and its ancestors**, not filter them out from the result.\n\n2. **Breaking change in behavior**: The original code stops at the first matching class in the MRO and filters everything after it. The patch changed this to filter members from ALL matching classes in the set, which changes the semantics.\n\n3. **Type annotation issue**: The return type includes `str` but the function can return a set, which is inconsistent.\n\n## Key Insights from the Issue\n\nThe feature request wants:\n- `:inherited-members: Parent2` should mean \"stop documenting inherited members when you reach Parent2 in the MRO\"\n- `:inherited-members: Parent2,Parent3` ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue description, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incorrect filtering logic**: The patch filters out members by checking if `name in c.__dict__` for excluded classes, but this doesn't correctly handle the inheritance chain. It should be checking if the member's defining class is in the excluded set.\n\n2. **Wrong interpretation of the feature**: The patch stops at the FIRST matching class in MRO and excludes everything after it. But based on the issue description and hints, the feature should work differently:\n   - When `:inherited-members: Parent2` is specified, it should **ignore members from Parent2 and all classes after it in MRO**\n   - When multiple classes are specified (e.g., `:inherited-members: list, set, tuple`), it should ignore members from ANY of those classes and their parents in MRO\n\n3. **Comparison issue**: The patch compares `obj` values with `cls.__dict__.values()` in the origin",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Wrong Logic for Filtering**\nThe previous patch finds the **first** matching stop class in MRO and excludes everything from that point onwards. This is incorrect because:\n- If you specify multiple stop classes (e.g., `Parent1,Parent3`), it only stops at the first one found\n- The current behavior (mentioned in hints) is to stop at a class and ignore everything after it in MRO\n- The new behavior should allow specifying **multiple** stop classes and exclude members from **all** of them\n\n### 2. **Misunderstanding of the Feature Request**\nThe issue asks for:\n- **Multiple stop classes**: Ability to specify a comma-separated list like `:inherited-members: list,dict,tuple`\n- **Exclude members from those specific classes**: Not stop at first match, but exclude members from ALL specified classes\n\n### 3. **Current Behavior vs Desired Behavior**\n- **Current**: `:inher",
