      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Logic inversion error**: The previous patch inverted the condition but kept the same chr() values in the wrong places:\n   - Changed `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):` to `if not (lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_')):`\n   - But this means symbols now get `chr(0)` prepended, which sorts them BEFORE everything (including other symbols)\n   - The original code had `chr(127)` for letters/underscores to push them AFTER symbols\n\n2. **Misunderstanding the sorting logic**: The original code prepends `chr(127)` to letters to make them sort AFTER symbols (since symbols without the prefix sort naturally before chr(127)). The patch broke this by:\n   - Making symbols get `chr(0)` prefix (sorts first)\n   - Making letters get no prefix (sorts by their natural value)\n   - This causes symbols to be split based on their natural Unicode ord",
