      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Docstring corruption**: The patch incorrectly modified the docstring by inserting the new `tomllib` example in the middle of existing documentation, breaking the structure. The lines got interleaved improperly:\n   - New example was inserted\n   - Then `:param filename:` description appeared\n   - Then the old `import toml` example appeared again\n   \n2. **Missing parameter documentation order**: The `:param text:` documentation was added after `:param silent:` but the parameter itself was added before `silent` in the function signature, creating inconsistency.\n\n3. **Test infrastructure failure**: The actual test couldn't run due to Docker image issues, but the patch itself has structural problems that would cause issues.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Correct the function signature**: Keep `text: bool = True` parameter but ensure it's placed logically (before `silent` is fine).\n\n2",
