      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the issue is that the Docker image wasn't built properly. However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### Critical Problems:\n\n1. **Incorrect method structure**: The patch tried to add a new method `visit_Assert` but then also kept the original docstring and implementation, creating a malformed method.\n\n2. **Missing `self.statements` initialization**: The `_rewrite_assert` method uses `self.statements` but the new code path doesn't initialize it before calling the original logic.\n\n3. **Incorrect recursion**: Used `self.visit_Assert.__wrapped__` which doesn't exist - should use the actual rewriting logic.\n\n4. **Return type inconsistency**: The original `visit_Assert` returns a list of statements, but the patch sometimes returns single statements or mixed types.\n\n5. **AST node visiting**: The `iter_expr` needs to be visited to ensure proper rewriting, but this wasn't done consistently.\n\n## Fix Plan",
