The patch tried to partially revert this, but the tests expect the strict behavior (no caption = no numbering).\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe tests that must pass are:\n- `test_numfig_without_numbered_toctree_warn`\n- `test_numfig_with_numbered_toctree_",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Logic error in the condition flow**: The patch correctly fixed the `list index out of range` error by checking if `titled_nodes` is empty before accessing it. However, it introduced a subtle bug in the control flow.\n\n2. **Duplicate condition check**: The patch has:\n   ```python\n   if title_node is None:\n       continue\n   \n   if title_node is None:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This creates two consecutive identical checks, which is redundant and suggests a logic error.\n\n3. **Indentation/structure issue**: The second `if title_node is None: continue` appears to be misplaced. Looking at the original code structure, after getting `title_node`, there should be a single check before proceeding to `get_section_number`.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe original code had:\n```python\ntitle_node = list(traverse_parent(node, is_titled_node))[-1]\nif title_node is None:\n    c",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Indentation error**: The patch has incorrect indentation - the final `if title_node is None:` check is at the wrong level, causing it to always execute regardless of the `figtype` check.\n\n2. **Logic flaw**: The code structure doesn't properly handle the case where `titled_nodes` is empty. The patch tries to fix the `list(traverse_parent(...))[-1]` issue when the list is empty, but the indentation makes the `continue` statement unreachable in the right context.\n\n3. **Missing the root cause**: The issue states that tables without captions/titles should not be numbered (per the `numfig` documentation), but the code should skip them gracefully without warnings. The previous patch doesn't address when/why the warning is generated.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Context\n\nFrom the issue description:\n- In Sphinx 3.3, commit `66dda1fc50249e9da62e79380251d8795b8e36df` c",
