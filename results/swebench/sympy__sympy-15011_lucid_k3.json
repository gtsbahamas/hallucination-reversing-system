      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch simply changed the default value of `dummify` from `False` to `True`. However, this caused test failures, which suggests that changing the default breaks existing functionality that relies on `dummify=False` behavior.\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\nThe issue states that the default should be to \"always dummify, unless dummify is explicitly False.\" However, simply changing the default parameter breaks backward compatibility - many existing tests and use cases expect `dummify=False` as the default behavior.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. The problem is specifically with **MatrixSymbol names containing special characters** (like curly braces `{}`), not with regular symbols\n2. Regular symbols with curly braces work fine: `sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)` succeeds\n3. The issue occurs when combining MatrixSymbols with invalid Python identifiers\n4. Even with `dummify=True` explicitly set, it still fails for MatrixSymbols with curly braces\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the code flow, the ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the error, I can see the issue:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch attempted to auto-detect when dummification is needed by checking if argument names are valid Python identifiers\n2. However, the check used `name.isidentifier()` which is only available in Python 3, but SymPy needs to support Python 2 as well (based on the imports like `from __future__ import print_function, division`)\n3. The error \"404 Client Error for docker image\" suggests the test environment couldn't be built, likely due to a syntax or compatibility issue\n\n**Key insights:**\n- The code imports `from sympy.core.compatibility import PY3` which indicates Python 2/3 compatibility is needed\n- The `keyword` module is already imported, so we can use `keyword.iskeyword()`\n- For identifier validation in a Python 2/3 compatible way, we need a different approach than `.isidentifier()`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Use a Python 2/3 compatible method to check for valid ide",

However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Wrong placement of dummify logic**\nThe auto-detection logic was placed AFTER `args` is processed but BEFORE the actual dummification happens. The dummification logic is further down in the code (around line 760+), so the auto-detection needs to happen earlier or the dummification needs to be triggered properly.\n\n### 2. **Missing import**\nThe patch uses `flatten` from `sympy.utilities.iterables` but doesn't ensure it's imported at the point where it's used in the new code block.\n\n### 3. **Incomplete understanding of the flow**\nLooking at the original code around line 742 (mentioned in hints), the actual dummification happens later in the function.
