      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can see several issues:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Problems\n\n1. **Incomplete code**: The patch cuts off mid-statement with `if arg.base.is_` - this is a syntax error\n2. **Overly complex logic**: The patch tries to detect when `fraction()` expands expressions, but the logic is convoluted and incomplete\n3. **Wrong approach**: Instead of trying to detect when `fraction()` does something bad, we should just avoid using it when we want to preserve the Mul structure\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure is actually a Docker image issue, not a code issue. However, looking at the original issue examples:\n\n1. **`exp(-x)*log(x)`**: Should print as `e^{-x} \\log(x)`, not `\\frac{1}{e^x} \\log(x)`\n2. **`1/(x+y)/2`**: Should print as `\\frac{1}{2(x+y)}`, not `\\frac{1}{2x+2y}`\n\nThe problem is that `fraction()` expands `(x+y)` when it's in a denominator.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe solution is simpler than the previous attempt:\n\n1. **Don't use `fr",
