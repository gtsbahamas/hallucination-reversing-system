The error occurs in the `canvas` property getter itself:\n\n```python\ncanvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\n```\n\nWhen `self.ref_artist.figure` is `None`, accessing `.canvas` on it raises `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'`.\n\n**The actual issue:**\nThe `_check_still_parented()` method calls `self.disconnect()`, which tries to access `self.canvas`. The `canvas` property assumes `self.ref_artist.figure` is not None, but after the artist is removed from the figure, `figure` becomes `None`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to be in the `canvas` property definition itself, not just in the `disconnect()` method. We need to handle the case where `self.ref_artist.figure` is `No",

However, this is insufficient because:\n\n1. **The error occurs in `_check_still_parented()`** - The traceback shows the error happens when `on_release` calls `_check_still_parented()`, which then calls `disconnect()`, which tries to access `self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)`.\n\n2. **The property access itself fails** - When `self.ref_artist.figure` is `None`, the lambda tries to access `.canvas` on `None`, causing the AttributeError before the property can even return `None`.\n\n3. **Root cause**: The `ref_artist.figure` becomes `None` when the artist is removed from the figure (likely by mplcursor), but the draggable callbacks are still active and try to access the canvas.",
