The patch tries to detect when a ForeignKey's `to_field` changes due to a referenced field rename\n2. It checks if `(related_app_label, related_model_name, old_to_field, new_to_field)` is in `self.renamed_fields`\n3. **Critical flaw**: The comparison logic is incomplete - it tries to skip the operation but doesn't properly verify that `to_field` is the ONLY differ",

The patch tried to detect when a ForeignKey's `to_field` changed due to a primary key rename by checking if there's a corresponding `RenameField` operation\n2. However, it accessed `old_field.remote_field.model` and `new_field.remote_field.model` which are **model classes**, not strings\n3. The comparison logic tried to match against `self.renamed_fields` but the key structure was incorrect\n4. Most critically: **The patch tried to skip generating an `AlterField` operation, but the real issue is that the `AlterField` operation is being generated with the WRONG `to_field` value** (the old field name instead of the new one)\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen a primary key field is renamed:\n1. A `RenameField` operation is correctly generated for the primary key\n2. Django then detects that ForeignKeys pointing to that model have \"changed\" (because their internal `to_field` reference still points to ",

The correct attribute is `old_field.remote_field.field_name` for the field being pointed to.\n2. **Logic error**: The patch tried to modify `old_",
