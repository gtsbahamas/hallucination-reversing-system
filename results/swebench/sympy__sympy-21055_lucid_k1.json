      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe previous patch added a `refine_arg` function but registered it in `handlers_dict` with the key `'arg'` (lowercase). However, the actual class name for the `arg` function in SymPy is `'arg'` with lowercase, but the handler lookup uses `expr.__class__.__name__`, which for the `arg` function would be something like `'arg'`.\n\nThe real issue is that the test is failing due to a Docker image error, not the code itself. However, looking at the code more carefully, there's a logical issue:\n\n**The key problem**: The function name in SymPy's `arg` function class is actually capitalized. Looking at the pattern in the handlers_dict:\n- `'Abs'` for absolute value\n- `'Pow'` for power\n- `'atan2'` for atan2\n\nThe `arg` function in SymPy is from `sympy.functions.elementary.complexes` and its class name is likely `'arg'` (lowercase).\n\nBut there's another issue: **The function returns `None` at the end i",
