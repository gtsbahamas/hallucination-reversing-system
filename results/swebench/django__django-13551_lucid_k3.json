Existing valid tokens generated before this change would become invalid because:\n1. Old tokens were generated with hash = `pk + password + login_timestamp + timestamp`\n2. New validation expects hash = `pk + password + login_timestamp + timestamp + email`\n3. These hashes won't match, invalidating all existing tokens immediately\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **The `timestamp` parameter is already part of the hash** - it's the last component in the original implementation\n2. **Order matters** ",

It should be called on the class, not the instance.\n\n### Additional Issues\n\n1. **Incorrect method call**: Should be `user.__class__.get_email_field_name()` or `type(user).get_email_field_name()`\n2. **Potential AttributeError**: If the user model doesn't have `get_email_field_name()` (e.g., custom user models), this will fail\n3. **Edge case handling**: The `or ''` is redundant since we already have a default of `''` in getattr\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n### ",

The fallback `lambda: 'email'` is incorrect - it returns a callable, not the method itself\n3. The approach doesn't properly handle the case where `get_email_field_name` doesn't exist\n\n### Key Insights\n\nFrom the Django codebase:\n- `AbstractBaseUser` has a class method `get_email_field_name()` that returns the name of the email field\n- Not all user models have an email field (as noted in the issue)\n- The method should gra",
