The `transform` method has a decorator/wrapper applied by scikit-learn's `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")` that converts the output to pandas format\n2. When `predict` calls `_transform` directly, it bypasses the wrapper, but the wrapper is still applied to the public `transform` method\n3. The issue is that `predict` should **never** return pandas output - it should always return a numpy array, even when `transform_output=\"pandas\"` is set\n\n**The real problem:**\nIn `IsotonicRegression`, the `predict` method calls `transform`, which gets wrapped by the pandas output decorator.

Having `transform` call `_transform` (which would get the pandas wrapper applied)\n3. Having `predict` call `_transform` directly and wrap with `np.asarray()` to avoid pandas output\n\nHowever, the test failed due to a Docker image build error, so we don't have actual test results. But analyzing the approach, there's a fundamental issue:\n\n**The problem with the previous patch:**\n- The `_transform` method would still be subject to the pandas output wrapper when called from `transform`\n- When `predict` calls `_transform`, it's calling the raw method, but the pandas wrapper is applied at the decorator level on `transform`, not on the method itself\n- The `np.asarray()` approach in `predict` is correct in principle, but the implementation doesn't properly handle the case where `_transform` might return a pandas Series\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct solution is s",

However, the test failed due to an infrastructure/Docker image issue, not because of the patch logic itself.\n\nLooking at the code more carefully, there's a critical problem with the previous approach:\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The import statement `from . import config_context` is incorrect - `config_context` is not a module but a function that needs to be imported from the correct location\n2. The correct import should be `from .utils._set_output import config_context` or similar\n\n**Key insights from the code:**\n- `IsotonicRegression.predict()` calls `self.transform(T)` \n- When `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")` is active, `transform()` returns a pandas DataFrame/Series\n- `CalibratedClassifierCV` expects numpy arrays and tries to assign the result to a numpy array slice: `proba[:,",
