However, this is insufficient because:\n\n1. `check_array` with `dtype=None` still tries to infer a numeric dtype by default\n2. When it encounters object arrays with strings, it attempts to convert them to float, causing the error: \"could not convert string to float: 'b'\"\n3. The issue states this worked in 0.21.1, and broke in PR #10830, which likely changed how `check_array` handles dtype validation\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\n- The test `test_format_invariance` is failing for multiple clustering metrics\n- These tests likely check that metrics work with various input formats including string labels\n- The error occurs during the `check_array` validation step, not in the actual metric computation\n\n**Root cause:**\nThe",
