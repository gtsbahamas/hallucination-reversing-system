This is problematic because:\n   - The original `slugify()` preserves underscores (they're part of `\\w` in the character class `[^\\w\\s-]`)\n   - Converting underscores to dashes is a breaking change that wasn't part of the original issue\n   - The issue only asks to **strip** leading/trailing dashes and underscores, not convert them\n\n2. **The regex pattern is incorrect**: Using `[-\\s_]+` in the substitution means internal underscores get converted to dashes, which changes the behavior beyond what was requested.\n\n## The Real Issue\n\nThe original issue shows:\n- Input: `\"___This is a test ---\"`\n- Current output: `\"___this-is-a-test-\"`\n- Desired output: `\"this-is-a-test\"`\n\nThe problem is that leading/trailing undersco",
