      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, it appears there was an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not a test failure from the patch itself. However, let me analyze the previous patch attempt to identify potential issues.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Incorrect logic flow**: The patch added an `elif` branch for `end is None or end == start + 1`, but this creates redundant/conflicting logic since the original code already handles these cases.\n\n2. **Incomplete decorator detection**: The check `tok[2][1] == 0` assumes decorators start at column 0, but in indented code (like inside a function), decorators would be indented and not at column 0.\n\n3. **Wrong stopping point**: When a decorator is detected, it sets `end = block_finder.last + start` and breaks, but `block_finder.last` might not be properly set yet if we break early.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn Python 3.9+, `BlockFinder` changed behavior and now includes decorator tokens that follow a stateme",
