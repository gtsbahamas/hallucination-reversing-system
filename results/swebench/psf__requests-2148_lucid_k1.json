      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the issue is that the Docker image failed to build, which prevented the tests from running. However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify the problem.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect exception handling scope**: The `socket.error` catch was placed inside the `try` block that only wraps `self.raw.stream()`, but it's nested within another `try` block. The structure creates an issue where the socket error might not be caught properly.\n\n2. **Missing import for socket module in Python 3**: While `socket` was imported, the code needs to handle both Python 2's `socket.error` and Python 3's `OSError` (since `socket.error` is an alias for `OSError` in Python 3).\n\n3. **Incomplete exception handling**: The patch only catches `socket.error` but doesn't account for other low-level network errors that could occur during streaming (like `IOError`).\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Catch socket errors at the right l",
