However, examining the code reveals a critical issue:\n\n**The main problem**: The `_draggable` attribute is initialized to `None` in `__init__`, but this happens **before** the legend is fully constructed. When `set_draggable(True)` is called at the end of `__init__`, it tries to create a `DraggableLegend` instance, which requires `self._legend_box` to exist. However, `_legend_box` is created much later in the initialization process (around line 688 in the original code).\n\n## Key Issues\n\n1. **Initialization order**: `self._draggable = None` is set too early (line 415), but `set_draggable(True)` is called at line 696, which is correct timing-wise.\n\n2. **Missing attribute**: The code initializes `self._draggable = None` but the original `draggable()` method expects this attribute to exist.
