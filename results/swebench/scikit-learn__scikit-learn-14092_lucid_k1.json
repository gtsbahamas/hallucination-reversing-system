      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch correctly changed the type checks from concrete types (`int`, `float`) to abstract base classes (`numbers.Integral`, `numbers.Real`). However, the tests are still failing, which suggests the issue is in the `check_scalar` function itself, not in how NCA calls it.\n\n**Key Insight from the Issue:**\nThe problem statement explicitly mentions:\n- For `tol`: the value `1` (an int) is not being accepted as a float\n- For `n_components`: `np.int64` is not being accepted as an int\n\nThe patch addresses this by using `numbers.Integral` and `numbers.Real`, which should accept numpy integer and float types. But if tests are still failing, it means `check_scalar` needs to be examined.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `check_scalar` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` likely has strict type checking that doesn't use `isinstance()` with the abstract base clas",
