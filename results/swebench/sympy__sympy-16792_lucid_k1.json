      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect union operation**: The line `for symbol in array.free_symbols.union(arg_list):` tries to union a set with a list, which works but is semantically confusing and doesn't properly handle the logic flow.\n\n2. **Redundant code**: The patch adds symbols from `arg_list` to `array_symbols` inside the loop over expressions, but then has another loop doing the same thing - this is redundant.\n\n3. **Logic placement**: The fix tries to add array symbols from `arg_list` but does so in a convoluted way that doesn't cleanly separate the two sources of array symbols (from expressions vs from arguments).\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe core issue is in the `make_routine` function around line 893-905. The code builds `array_symbols` dictionary **only** from symbols that appear in `expressions` (via `free_symbols`). When a `MatrixSymbol` argument doesn't appear in any ex",
