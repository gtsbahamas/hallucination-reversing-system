      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Logic error**: The patch breaks out of the tokenization loop as soon as it finds a decorator (`@`), but this is too aggressive. It stops processing tokens immediately, which means `block_finder.tokeneater()` never gets called for most tokens.\n\n2. **Incorrect decorator detection**: The code checks if `@` is at column 0, but this doesn't account for indented decorators (which are common inside functions/classes).\n\n3. **Line tracking issue**: The `current_line` counter is incremented AFTER checking for decorators, so the timing is off.\n\n4. **Breaks BlockFinder**: By breaking early, the patch prevents `BlockFinder` from doing its job of finding where the code block actually ends.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe real issue is that in Python 3.9+, the AST includes decorator lines as part of the statement range. When we have:\n\n```python\nassert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\n\n@t\nde",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to detect decorators by checking if a line starts with `@` and comparing indentation levels\n2. However, this approach is too simplistic - it doesn't account for the actual AST structure\n3. The logic checks if a decorator is at \"same or less indentation\" than the start line, but this doesn't correctly identify when a decorator belongs to a nested function vs. being part of the current statement\n\n**Key Issue from the Bug Report:**\nIn Python 3.9+, when an assert statement is followed by a decorated function definition, the error output incorrectly includes the decorator line (`@t`) as part of the assert statement. This happens because the AST parsing in Python 3.9+ changed how it reports line numbers for statements.\n\n**The Real Problem:**\nThe issue is that `get_statement_startend2()` uses `bisect_right` to find statement boundaries base",
