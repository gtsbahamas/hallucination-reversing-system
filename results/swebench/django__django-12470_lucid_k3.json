      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to handle `col == 'pk'` specially when `self._meta_ordering` is set\n2. However, it still called `self.query._resolve_field('pk', None)[0]` which likely resolves to the wrong table reference for inherited models\n3. The core issue is that when `'pk'` appears in `Meta.ordering` of a parent model, and we query a child model, the field resolution needs to understand the inheritance relationship\n\n**Key Insight from the Issue:**\nThe SQL shows the query is ordering by `\"myapp_parent\".\"id\" ASC` when it should be `DESC`. This means:\n- The field is being resolved to the parent table (correct)\n- But the descending flag is being lost or not applied (incorrect)\n\n**Root Cause:**\nLooking at the code flow more carefully:\n1. `get_order_dir(field, asc)` strips the `-` and returns `col='pk'` and `order='DESC'`\n2. `descending = order == 'DESC'` should be `T",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect condition check**: The patch checks `if col == 'pk'` but at this point in the code, `col` has already been processed by `get_order_dir()` which strips the ordering prefix. However, the original field string was `\"-pk\"`, and after `get_order_dir()` processes it, `col` becomes `\"pk\"` but we've lost context about whether this came from Meta.ordering.\n\n2. **Wrong resolution approach**: The patch tries to resolve `pk_name` using `self.query.resolve_ref()`, but this doesn't properly handle the table alias resolution needed for inherited models. In inherited models, the primary key field exists on the parent table, not the child table.\n\n3. **Timing issue**: The check happens too late in the logic flow. By this point, we need to ensure the field reference points to the correct table (parent table in inheritance scenarios).\n\n## Key Insights from",

The patch modifies the `ordering` list after it's been assigned, but this happens too late in the flow\n2. The modification only applies when `self._meta_ordering` is set, but this flag is set AFTER the ordering is determined (line 327 in original code)\n3. The patch creates a new list comprehension that replaces 'pk' with the actual field name, but this doesn't preserve the original ordering list structure properly\n4. Most critically: the patch doesn't account for the fact that in inherited models, the 'pk' field needs to be resolved to the correct table alias, not just the field name\n\n## Key Insights from the Issue\n\nThe problem is that when a child model inherits from a parent with `ordering = [\"-pk\"]`:\n- The query joins the child and parent tables\n- The ordering should use the parent table's pk column with DESC\n- But currently it's using ASC instea",
