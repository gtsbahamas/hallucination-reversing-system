However, the test failure appears to be an infrastructure/Docker issue (\"404 Client Error... No such image\"), not a logic error in the patch.\n\n**The actual fix needed:**\nThe patch is on the right track but has a subtle issue. When the `PolynomialError` is caught and `G` is set to `S.One`, the code continues to the line:\n```python\npwas, qwas = p, q\n```\n\nBut `p` and `q` haven't been updated in the except block. The original code would have updated them via:\n```python\np, q = [gcd_terms(i/G, clear=False, fraction=False) for i in (p, q)]\n```\n\nThis means when `G != 1` but we catch the exception, we lose the potential simplification that `gcd_terms` would provide.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe patch should be refined to ensure `p` and `q` remai",

However, the test failure is due to a Docker image build error, not a code issue. The actual problem is that the patch is incomplete - it doesn't address the root cause mentioned in the issue analysis.\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n\n1. The real problem is in the **old assumptions system** storing `None` in the assumptions dict when an exception occurs during a query\n2. The `sinh.is_real` handler calls `(im % pi).is_zero` which triggers `Mod` \u2192 `gcd` \u2192 `PolynomialError`\n3. When the exception is raised, `None` remains in `_assumptions` dict, causing non-deterministic behavior based on cache state\n4. The `Mod.eval` fix is necessary but not sufficient\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\nThe previous patch correctly handles point #2 (catching PolynomialError in Mod), bu",

However, the test failure is due to a Docker image build error, not a code issue. The actual patch logic is sound.\n\n**The real issue:**\nThe problem occurs when:\n1. `exp(sinh(Piecewise(...) / z))` is evaluated with real symbols\n2. During `subs({1: 1.0})`, the exponential checks `arg.is_zero`\n3. This triggers `sinh._eval_is_real()` which does `(im % pi).is_zero`\n4. The `Mod` operation calls `gcd(p, q)` where `p` contains a `Piecewise`\n5. `gcd` raises `PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense`\n6. The exception leaves `None` in the assumptions cache, causing non-deterministic behavior\n\n**What the patch does correctly:**\n- Catches `PolynomialError` when `gcd` is called with `Piecewise` expressions\n- Falls back to `G = S.One` (no GCD simplification) wh",
