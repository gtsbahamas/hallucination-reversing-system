      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect usage of `svd_flip`**: The patch called `svd_flip(self.alphas_, np.empty_like(self.alphas_).T)`, passing an empty array as the second argument (V matrix). This is incorrect because `svd_flip` expects actual right singular vectors to compute the sign flip properly.\n\n2. **Wrong matrix dimensions**: `svd_flip` is designed for SVD decomposition where you have U and V^T matrices. In KernelPCA, `self.alphas_` are eigenvectors (similar to U in SVD), but we don't have a corresponding V matrix since we're doing eigendecomposition, not SVD.\n\n3. **Misunderstanding of the function**: `svd_flip` works by finding the maximum absolute value in each column of U and V^T, then flipping signs to make the largest absolute values positive. For KernelPCA eigenvectors, we only need to flip based on the eigenvectors themselves.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to cha",

      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch failed during the Docker image build phase, not during actual test execution. This is an infrastructure issue, not a problem with the patch logic itself. However, let's analyze the patch conceptually:\n\n```python\nself.alphas_, _ = svd_flip(self.alphas_, \n                           np.empty((self.alphas_.shape[1], 0)))\n```\n\n**Critical Issue**: The `svd_flip` function expects two matrices `u` and `v` from an SVD decomposition where:\n- `u` has shape `(n_samples, n_components)`\n- `v` has shape `(n_components, n_features)` or `(n_features, n_components)` transposed\n\nThe patch passes an **empty array** `np.empty((self.alphas_.shape[1], 0))` as the second argument, which doesn't make sense. The `svd_flip` function uses both matrices to determine the sign flip based on which columns have the largest absolute values.\n\n### Key Insights from the Code\n\n1. **KernelPCA uses eigendecomposition**, not SVD. The `alphas_` are e",

In `fit_transform()`, the result is: `self.alphas_ * np.sqrt(self.lambdas_)`\n2. In `transform()`, the result is: `np.dot(K, self.alphas_ / np.sqrt(self.lambdas_))`\n\nThe sign flipping was applied to `self.alphas_` after sorting, which affects both methods.
