      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply correctly due to a malformed diff format. The issue was that I tried to apply the same patch twice to the same file, which created duplicate hunks.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Malformed patch**: The diff had duplicate sections trying to patch the same file twice\n2. **Incorrect hunk locations**: The line numbers in the second hunk were wrong due to the duplication\n3. **Missing logic flow**: The patch didn't account for the complete control flow in `_array_converter`\n\n## Key Insights from Code Structure\n\nLooking at the `_array_converter` method more carefully:\n\n1. There are two main code paths:\n   - **Path 1** (lines ~1210-1230): Handles when args are `(coords[N][naxis], origin)` - a single 2D array\n   - **Path 2** (lines ~1230-1270): Handles when args are `(x, y, ..., origin)` - separate 1D arrays per axis\n\n2. The empty array check needs to happen **before** calling `func(xy, origin)` which calls the underlying wcslib C function that throws t",
