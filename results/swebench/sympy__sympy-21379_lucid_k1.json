      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe patch itself is technically correct - it catches `PolynomialError` when calling `gcd()` and sets `G = S.One` as a fallback. However, the test results show a Docker image build failure, not a test failure with the patch logic. This is an infrastructure issue, not a code issue.\n\n**The actual fix needed:**\nThe patch is good and should work. The key insight is:\n\n1. **Root cause**: When `Mod.eval()` calls `gcd(p, q)` on expressions containing `Piecewise`, the `gcd` function raises `PolynomialError` because it cannot handle `Piecewise` as polynomial generators.\n\n2. **The fix**: Wrap the `gcd()` call in a try-except block to catch `PolynomialError` and fall back to `G = S.One` (no GCD extraction), allowing the rest of the `Mod` evaluation to proceed.\n\n3. **Why this works**: \n   - The GCD extraction is an optimization, not required for correctness\n  ",
