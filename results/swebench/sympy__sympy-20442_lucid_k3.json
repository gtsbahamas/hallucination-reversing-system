Using `solve` instead would properly fail when dimensions are incompatible.\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nThe previous patch has the right approach but needs refinement:\n\n1. **Exception handling is too broad**: `solve` can raise multiple exception types, not just `ValueErro",

The `solve` method requires the matrix to be square and invertible, but in the `convert_to` function, the conversion matrix (`camat`) is often **not square** - it can have different numbers of rows and columns depending on the dimensional dependencies.\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\n```python\ncamat = Matrix([[dimension_system.get_dimensional_dependencies(i, mark_dimensionless=True).get(j, 0) \n                 for i in target_dims] for j in canon_dim_units])\n```\n\n- Rows: `canon_dim_units` (canonical dimension units from expression)\n- Columns: `target_dims` (target dimensions)\n\nThese don't have to match in count, making the matrix rectangular in many cases.\n\n**Why the original code was problematic:**\n`solve_least_squares` finds a",
