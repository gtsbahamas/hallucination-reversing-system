      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe test results show a Docker image build failure, not a test execution failure. This means we cannot determine if the patch actually fixes the issue from these results. However, I can analyze the patch logic itself.\n\n## Issues with Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch added a check `if str_number and str_number[0] == \"-\":` which prevents the IndexError when `str_number` is empty. However, this approach has a **critical flaw**:\n\n**The root cause is earlier in the code.** When `number` is `None` or an empty value:\n- Line 78: `str_number = str(number)` converts `None` to the string `\"None\"` (not an empty string)\n- An empty string would only occur if `number` is already an empty string `\"\"`\n\nSo the patch prevents the IndexError for empty strings, but **doesn't handle `None` values properly**, which would result in the output `\"None\"` instead of an appropriate representation.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe proper fix should:\n\n1. **Handle `None` explicitly** before ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch returns an empty string `\"\"` for `None` or empty string inputs\n2. However, the test `test_empty` likely expects a different behavior - probably `mark_safe(\"\")` instead of just `\"\"`\n3. The function is supposed to return a `mark_safe()` wrapped value (as seen in the early return for integers), but the patch returns a plain string\n\n**Key insights from the code:**\n- Line 36 shows the fast path returns `mark_safe(number)` for integers\n- The function signature and behavior suggest all returns should be `mark_safe()` wrapped\n- The original issue is the `IndexError` at line 83: `if str_number[0] == \"-\"` when `str_number` is empty\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct fix should:\n\n1. **Keep the None/empty check at the top** - this is good defensive programming\n2. **Return `mark_safe(\"\")` instead of just `\"\"`** - to maintain consistency with other return values",
