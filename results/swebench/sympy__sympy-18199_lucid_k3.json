However, this is **too simplistic** because:\n\n1. When `a % p == 0`, zero is indeed a root, but there might be **other roots** as well\n2. The function should find **all** roots when `all_roots=True`, not just return `[0]`\n3. The early return prevents the function from finding any non-zero roots that might exist\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nThe issue states: \"When in the equation x**n = a mod p, when a % p == 0. Then x = 0 mod p is **also** a root\" - note the word \"also\", meaning 0 is an **additional** root, not necessarily the only one.\n\n**Example from the issue:**\n`nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)` should return 0 as a root because:\n- `17*17 % 17 = 0`\n- `0**5 % 17 = 0`\n- So 0 is a valid root\n\nBut there might be other values `x` where `x**5 % 17 = 0` as ",

It added an early return when `a % p == 0` (lines 717-718)\n2. But then it ALSO added checks later in the `all_roots` branch (line 759) and the single root branch (lines 767-768)\n3. These later checks are **unreachable code** because of the early return\n4. The patch was messy with duplicate logic scattered throughout\n\n## The Core Issue\n\nWhen `a \u2261 0 (mod p)`, the equation `x^n \u2261 0 (mod p)` has **only one solution**: `x \u2261 0 (mod p)`.\n\nThis is because in modular arithmetic mod a prime `p`:\n- If `x \u2262 0 (mod p)`, then `x^n \u2262 0 (mod p)` (since p is prime, no zero divisors)\n- Therefore, `x \u2261 0 (mod p)` is the unique solution\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix should be **simple and clean**:\n\n1. **Add a single early check** right after parameter conversion\n2. **Return immediately** with `[0]` if `all_roots=True`, or `0` if `all_roots=",

It returns `0` (or `[0]`) whenever `a % p == 0`, but this is wrong because:\n\n1. **Not all cases where `a % p == 0` have `x = 0` as a root**. The equation is `x^n \u2261 a (mod p)`. If `a \u2261 0 (mod p)`, we need `x^n \u2261 0 (mod p)`, which means `x \u2261 0 (mod p)` is indeed a root, BUT...\n\n2. **There may be OTHER roots besides 0**. For example, with `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)`:\n   - `a = 289 \u2261 0 (mod 17)`\n   - We need `x^5 \u2261 0 (mod 17)`\n   - `x = 0` works: `0^5 = 0 \u2261 0 (mod 17)` \u2713\n   - But `x = 17` also works in the original domain (though `17 \u2261 0 (mod 17)`)\n   \n3. **The patch returns ONLY 0, ignoring any other potential roots** that the original algorithm would find.\n\n4. **Early return prevents the rest of the function from executing**, so it doesn't compute other roots that might exist.\n\n## Key Insights from the Test Output\n\nThe test f",
