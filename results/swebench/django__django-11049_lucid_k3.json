This is an infrastructure issue, not a code issue.\n\n2. **The patch itself has a logical problem**: Adding `help_text` in `__init__` will override any user-provided `help_text`, which is incorrect behavior. The `setdefault` approach is right, but we need to be careful about when it's applied.\n\n3. **Missing consideration**: The help_text should only be set as a default if the user hasn't provided one, and it should work with the Field's existing initialization pattern.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe core issue is straightforward - we need to:\n\n1. **Fix the error message format string**: Change `[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]` to `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]` to correctly indicate that:\n   - Seconds are mandatory\n   - Minutes are optional (but",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect `__init__` override**: The patch added an `__init__` method to `DurationField` that sets a default `help_text`. However, this approach has issues:\n   - It doesn't call the parent's `__init__` properly with all arguments\n   - The condition `if 'help_text' not in kwargs` doesn't account for the fact that `help_text` might be passed as a positional argument\n   - Adding default help_text in `__init__` is not the Django pattern - it should be a class attribute\n\n2. **Test infrastructure failure**: The test didn't actually run due to Docker image issues, but the code logic itself has problems.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. The error message format correction is **correct**: `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]` properly indicates that:\n   - Seconds are mandatory\n   - Minutes are optional (but if provided, must include the colon)\n   - Hours are optional (but if pr",

According to the actual behavior:\n- Input `\"14:00\"` \u2192 interpreted as `\"00:14:00\"` (14 minutes, 0 seconds)\n- This means the format is actually: `[[HH:]MM:]ss`\n\nThe previous patch changed it to `\"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]\"`, which appears correct based on the issue description.\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch was actually **correct** in terms of the code change. The test failure was due to infrastructure issues (Docker image not found), not a logical error in the fix.\n\n## The Correct Fix\n\nThe fix should be exactly what was in the previous patch:\n\n```python\n'invalid': _(",
