      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed because of an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not because of the logic itself. However, looking at the patch more carefully, there's a critical flaw in the approach:\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch simply skips the `toggle()` calls when `ax.axis` is a method, which means tick labels won't be controlled at all for non-mpl_axes.Axes classes\n2. This defeats the purpose of `label_mode` - the grid won't properly hide/show tick labels as intended\n3. The test expects the axes to work properly with label control, not just \"not crash\"\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\nLooking at the suggested fix in the issue hints, the proper solution is to create `SimpleAxisArtist` objects on-the-fly for standard axes that don't have the special `axis` dict. The `SimpleAxisArtist` class wraps the standard xaxis/yaxis and provides the same `toggle()` interface.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Import `SimpleAxisArtist`** from `.mpl_axes` module (it's already available th",

The error indicates:\n```\n404 Client Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.51/images/swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.matplotlib_1776_matplotlib-26020:latest/json: Not Found\n```\n\nThis is an infrastructure issue, not a problem with the patch logic itself. However, let me analyze the patch for potential issues:\n\n### Issues with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Import of `SimpleAxisArtist`**: The patch imports `SimpleAxisArtist` from `.mpl_axes`, but we need to verify this class exists and has the required `toggle()` method.\n\n2. **Type checking approach**: Using `isinstance(ax.axis, MethodType)` is fragile - it assumes that if `axis` is a method, we need to create wrappers, but this doesn't account for all possible axis implementations.\n\n3. **SimpleAxisArtist instantiation**: The patch creates `SimpleAxisArtist` instances on-the-fly, but we need to ensure:\n   - This clas",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch simply **skipped** the axis manipulation when `ax.axis` doesn't have `__getitem__` (i.e., when it's a method rather than a dict). This means:\n\n1. For axes classes like `GeoAxes` where `axis` is a method, the function returns early without doing anything\n2. This prevents the error, but it also **fails to apply the intended tick label configuration**\n3. The test `test_grid_with_axes_class_not_overriding_axis` likely expects the axes to still have proper tick label behavior, even if they don't use the special `axis` dict\n\n## Key Insights from the Test Output\n\nThe test name `test_grid_with_axes_class_not_overriding_axis` suggests it's testing axes classes that don't override the `axis` attribute with a dict. The test is failing because the previous patch doesn't handle these axes properly - it just skips them entirely.\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\n",
