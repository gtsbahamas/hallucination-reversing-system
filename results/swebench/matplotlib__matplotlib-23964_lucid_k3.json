      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch added a duplicate check `if curr_stream and stream:` on line 669, but this creates a logic error. The issue is that when `curr_stream` is empty (which happens with empty lines in text), `_text_helpers.ps_font_subset_to_stream()` is never called, so `stream` is never defined. Then the code tries to iterate over `stream` which doesn't exist in that scope.\n\n**The actual problem:**\nWhen text contains an empty line (like `'\\nLower label'`), the loop processes it but `curr_stream` ends up empty for that line. The code at line 666-667 calls `ps_font_subset_to_stream()` only when `curr_stream` is not empty, but then unconditionally tries to iterate over `stream` at line 669, even though `stream` was never assigned in the empty line case.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n```python\nif curr_stream:\n    stream = _text_helpers.ps_f",
