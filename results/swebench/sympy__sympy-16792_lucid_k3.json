However, this approach has a fundamental flaw:\n\n**The problem occurs earlier in the pipeline** - in the `make_routine` function. When creating `InputArgument` objects, the code only processes symbols from `ordered_symbols` (which are extracted from the expression). Since unused arguments don't appear in the expression, they never get processed with their dimension information.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `make_routine` (around line 862), the code does:\n```python\nfor symbol in ordered_symbols:\n```\n\nBut `ordered_symbols` only contains symbols that appear in the expression. When `expr = 1.0`, a MatrixSymbol `x` passed in `argument_sequence` won't be in `ordered_symbols`, so it never gets converted to an `InputArgument` with proper dimensions.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Premature dimension storage**: The patch stores dimensions for `MatrixSymbol` arguments early in the loop (lines 814-816), but this happens *before* the code that processes sequence arguments that might contain dimension information.\n\n2. **Logic flow problem**: The patch tries to process `argument_sequence` twice - once to store dimensions, then again to build the full symbol list. This creates confusion about when dimensions are captured.\n\n3. **Incomplete dimension capture**: When a `MatrixSymbol` is passed directly (not in a sequence), the patch stores `[arg.shape]` in `array_symbols`, but the shape is a tuple like `(2, 1)`. Later code expects `dims` to be a list of tuples representing bounds for each dimension, not a list containing a single shape tuple.\n\n4. **Test failure**: The test couldn't even run due to Docker image issues, but th",

However, this approach has a critical flaw: it tries to extract the symbol from arguments before they're properly processed, and the logic for extracting `sym` from different argument types is incomplete and incorrect.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. The code tries to handle `OutputArgument`, `InputArgument`, and `InOutArgument` objects, but at that point in the code, `argument_sequence` may contain raw symbols, not yet wrapped in Argument objects\n2. The extraction logic `sym = arg.name` assumes these are already Argument objects, but they might just be raw `MatrixSymbol` objects\n3.
