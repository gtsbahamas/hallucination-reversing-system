      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch attempted to replace `solve_least_squares` with `solve`, which is the right direction. However, **the test failed due to an infrastructure/Docker issue**, not because the logic was wrong. The error message shows:\n```\n404 Client Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.51/images/swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.sympy_1776_sympy-20442:latest/json: Not Found\n```\n\nThis is an environment setup problem, not a code problem.\n\n## What Was Right About the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Correctly identified the root cause**: Using `solve_least_squares` instead of `solve` causes the function to return approximate solutions when exact solutions don't exist\n2. **Proper error handling**: Catching `ValueError` and returning `None` is the right approach\n3. **The logic is sound**: When dimensions are incompatible, `solve()` will raise an exception, which gets caught and returns `None",
