      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe test results show a Docker image build error, not a test failure from the actual code. This is an infrastructure issue, not a problem with the patch logic itself.\n\nHowever, looking at the previous patch more carefully, there's a **critical flaw in the approach**:\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch tried to temporarily add `cvargs` as attributes, call `_build_repr`, then delete them. This approach has several issues:\n\n1. **Attribute pollution**: Temporarily modifying the object's attributes is fragile and could cause issues if `_build_repr` or any other code caches references\n2. **Potential conflicts**: If any of the `cvargs` keys already exist as attributes, we'd be overwriting them\n3. **Not thread-safe**: Multiple threads calling `__repr__` simultaneously could interfere with each other\n\n### Key Insight from Code Structure\n\nLooking at `_build_repr` (from `sklearn.base._pprint`), it:\n1.

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch added `setattr(self, key, value)` in `__init__` to expose `cvargs` parameters as attributes\n2. However, this creates **duplicate attributes** - the parameters are stored both in `self.cvargs` dict AND as individual attributes\n3. This violates the design pattern where `cvargs` is meant to be passed to the underlying CV class, not stored as direct attributes of `_RepeatedSplits`\n\n**Why it failed:**\nThe test results show a Docker image build error, but the fundamental issue is architectural - the approach of duplicating `cvargs` as attributes is not clean and could cause maintenance issues.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `_build_repr()` function (from `sklearn.base._pprint`) only looks at direct attributes of the object. Since `n_splits` is stored in `self.cvargs` dict rather than as `self.n_splits`, it doesn't appear in the repr output.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n*",
