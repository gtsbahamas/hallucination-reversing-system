      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the issue is that the Docker image failed to build. However, I can analyze the code logic to identify the problem with the previous patch.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### Main Problem: Infinite Recursion\n\nThe critical flaw is in `_unroll_all_any()`:\n\n```python\n# Recursively visit the inner assert to apply rewriting\ninner_statements = self.visit_Assert(inner_assert)\n```\n\nThis creates **infinite recursion** because:\n1. `visit_Assert()` is called on the original `assert all(...)`\n2. It detects it's unrollable and calls `_unroll_all_any()`\n3. `_unroll_all_any()` creates a new assert with the inner expression\n4. It calls `visit_Assert()` on this new assert\n5. **BUT** - if the inner expression itself is an `all()` or `any()` call, we go back to step 2\n6. Even if it's not, `visit_Assert()` will call `_is_unrollable_all_or_any()` again on the same node structure\n\n### Secondary Issues\n\n1. **Missing AST node copying**: The code reuses AST nodes (`elt`, `lo",

This breaks the visitor pattern used by the AST rewriter.\n\n2. **Recursive Visit Issue**: The patch calls `self.visit_Assert(inner_assert)` recursively, which returns the modified `self.statements` list. However, this doesn't properly integrate with the existing assertion rewriting flow.\n\n3. **Statement Management**: The existing `visit_Assert` method appends to `self.statements` and returns `None`. The unrolling code tries to return statements directly, which is inconsistent.\n\n4. **Missing Integration**: The unrolled for loop needs to be added to `sel",
