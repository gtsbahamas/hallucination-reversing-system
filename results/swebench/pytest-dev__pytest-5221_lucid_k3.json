However, looking at the code more carefully, the actual issue is likely that the patch is incomplete.\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n1. The patch only modified the `showfixtures` function to display `[scope]` in the output\n2. However, looking at the test names (`test_show_fixtures` and `test_show_fixtures_verbose`), there are likely two different display modes\n3. The `-v` (verbose) flag behavior needs to be considered - fixtures with leading `_` are only shown with `-v` according to the help text\n4.
