      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch added the checks in the wrong order. It placed the new conditions for `0**-oo` and `0**oo` BEFORE the existing check `elif e == -1 and not b:` which handles the general case of `0**-1 -> zoo`.\n\nThe problem is that the condition `e == -1 and not b` uses `not b` which evaluates to `True` when `b is S.Zero`. However, the new checks use `b is S.Zero` which is more specific. When placed after the general check, they become unreachable for the case where `e == -1`.\n\nMore critically, the test failure appears to be an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not a logic error. However, we should still fix the logical ordering issue.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Order matters**: The checks need to be ordered from most specific to most general\n2. **The existing check** `elif e == -1 and not b:` already handles `0**-1 -> zoo`\n3. **We need to ad",
