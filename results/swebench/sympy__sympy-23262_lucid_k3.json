However, the test failed due to an infrastructure/Docker image issue, not because the logic was wrong. The error message shows:\n```\n404 Client Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.51/images/swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.sympy_1776_sympy-23262:latest/json: Not Found\n```\n\nThis is an environment setup problem, not a code problem.\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n1. The patch logic is correct - it properly handles the three cases:\n   - Empty tuple: `()`\n   - Single element tuple: `(element,)` with trailing comma\n   - Multiple element tuple: `(elem1, elem2, ...)`\n\n2. The issue description shows the problem clearly: `(1)` is being generated instead of `(1,)` for single-element tuples\n\n3. The patch targets the right location in `sympy/pr",

Checking if tuple length is 1\n2. Adding the trailing comma: `\"({},)\".format(self._print(expr[0]))`\n3. This matches Python's syntax requirement for single-element tuples\n\n### Why It's Correct\n- **Empty tuple**: `()` \u2713\n- **Single-element tuple**: `(1,)` \u2713 (with trailing comma)\n- **Multi-element tuple**: `(1, 2)` \u2713\n\nThe logic is sound and addresses the exact issue described where `(1)` was being generated instead of `(1,)`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**The patch is already correct.** The test failure is due to Docker infrastructure issues, not code problems. The fix should be:\n\n1. **Keep the exact same patch** - no code changes needed\n2. **Retry the test** with proper ",
