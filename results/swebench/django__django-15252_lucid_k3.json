Looking at how Django's router works elsewhere in the codebase (e.g., in `executor.py`), it should pass the model class itself.\n\n### 3. **Logic issue in `applied_migrations()`**\nThe patch returns an empty dict when the router disallows migration, but this could cause issues if migrations were previously applied befor",
