The variable is set inside a conditional block but used outside of it.\n\n2. **Logic error**: The code tries to check for `_order` references in indexes/constraints, but this check happens too early and the variable scope is wrong.\n\n3. **Incomplete skip logic**: The `continue` statement in `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` doesn't actually skip the operation - it just continues the loop, but the operation still gets added afterward.\n\n4. **Missing break**: After finding a matching CreateModel operation, the code should break out of the loop, not continue.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Requirements\n\nThe tests indicate we need to handle:\n- Models created with `order_with_respect_to` AND indexes/constraints referencing `_order`\n- Both new models and existing ",

The `if not skip_alter:` check wasn't properly indented, causing the rest of the function to be incorrectly nested.\n\n2. **Logic Issue**: The patch only handles NEW models (`self.new_model_keys`), but the issue also affects EXISTING models when `order_with_respect_to` and indexes referencing `_order` are added at the same time.\n\n3. **Incomplete Check**: The patch checks if `order_with_respect_to` was included in `CreateModel.options`, but for existing models, there's no `CreateModel` operation - we need to handle the case where both `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` are generated for an existing model.\n\n### Key Insights from Issue Description\n\n1.
