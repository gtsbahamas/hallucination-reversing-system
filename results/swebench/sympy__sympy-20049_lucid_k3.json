      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Not setting the velocity in the cache**: The patch calculates the velocity but returns it directly without storing it in `self._vel_dict`. This means:\n   - Subsequent calls recalculate unnecessarily\n   - The velocity isn't \"defined\" for the point, which may break other code expecting it to be set\n\n2. **Incorrect velocity calculation**: The line `vel = otherpoint.vel(frame) + pos.dt(frame)` is wrong. The time derivative `pos.dt(frame)` already includes the full velocity contribution from the changing position. Adding `otherpoint.vel(frame)` would double-count if `otherpoint` is moving.\n\n3. **Missing the key insight**: Looking at how `ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in()` works (mentioned in the issue), it likely **sets** the calculated value, not just returns it. The automatic calculation should also **set** the velocity.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach should:\n\n1. **C",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Wrong velocity calculation formula**\nThe previous patch used:\n```python\nvel = otherpoint.vel(frame) + pos.dt(frame)\n```\n\nThis is **incorrect**. The correct formula should be:\n```python\nvel = pos.dt(frame) + otherpoint.vel(frame)\n```\n\nBut more importantly, `pos.dt(frame)` already includes the contribution from `otherpoint`'s velocity when there are moving reference frames involved. The issue is that we're **double-counting** the velocity.\n\n### 2. **Misunderstanding of the physics**\nWhen we have:\n- Point Q at position `r` from point P\n- We want Q's velocity in frame A\n\nThe correct formula is simply:\n```python\nvel_Q_in_A = d/dt(pos_Q_from_P) + vel_P_in_A\n```\n\nBut `pos.dt(frame)` computes the time derivative of the position vector in the given frame, which is exactly what we need when P is stationary. However, when P is moving, we need to add P's velocity.\n\n#",
