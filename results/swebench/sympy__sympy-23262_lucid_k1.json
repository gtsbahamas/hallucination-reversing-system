      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and test results, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe previous patch attempted to add `_print_tuple` and `_print_list` methods, but the issue is that these methods likely already exist in the file. The patch format suggests adding new methods at the end, but the actual problem is that an existing `_print_tuple` method is not handling single-element tuples correctly.\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n1. The bug was introduced in commit 6ccd2b07ded5074941bb80b5967d60fa1593007a from PR #21993\n2. SymPy 1.9: `tuple([1])` \u2192 `(1,)` \u2713 (correct)\n3. SymPy 1.10: `tuple([1])` \u2192 `(1)` \u2717 (missing comma - returns int instead of tuple)\n4. The workaround using SymPy's `Tuple` works, suggesting `_print_Tuple` is correct\n5. The issue is specifically with Python's built-in `tuple` type\n\n**The real problem:**\nLooking at the code structure in `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, there are two sepa",
