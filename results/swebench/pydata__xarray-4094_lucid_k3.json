Filtering out the dimension name from variables\n\n**What was wrong:**\n- The patch modified the wrong part of the code - it was looking at `to_stacked_array` logic when the issue is in `to_unstacked_dataset`\n- The actual problem is that when unstacking a single-dimension variable, the stacked dimension coordinate 'y' appears both as a coordinate AND gets included in the data variables, causing a merge conflict\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen `to_stacked_array` creates a stacked array with `sample_dims=['x']`, it creates a new dimension 'y' with a coordinate. When `to_unstacked_dataset` tries to unstack:\n\n1. For single-dim variables, the index on 'y' is NOT a MultiIndex (it's just a regular Index with values",

However, this approach has a fundamental flaw:\n\n1. The patch modified the wrong part of the code - it's filtering `coords` but the actual problem is in how the data variables are being created\n2. The logic for creating `data_dict` is incomplete - it's trying to iterate over `variables` and `index_variables` together with `zip()`, but these may not have the same length or structure\n3. The code has undefined behavior with `variable.reindex()` and `variable.sel()` being called in a loop that doesn't make sense\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\nThe test failed with a Docker image error, but based on the issue description, the actual error is:\n- `MergeError: conflicting values for variable 'y' on obje",
