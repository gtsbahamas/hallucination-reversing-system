The issue is on line 700 where `if doc:` is evaluated - at this point, `doc` could still be an integer (or other non-string type).\n\n**Root cause:**\nWhen `ast.get_docstring(mod)` is called on a module whose first expression is a number (like `0`), it incorrectly returns that number instead of `None` or a string. The code then tries to use this integer as if it were a string docstring.\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nLooking at line 695 in the original code:\n```python\nif self.is_rewrite_disabled(doc):\n    return\n\nif doc:\n    # ... code that assumes doc is a string\n```\n\nThe issue is that:\n1. `ast.get_docstring()` can return non-string values in edge cases\n2.
