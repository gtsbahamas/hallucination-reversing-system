This means the comparison will always be `True` (they're different objects), even when `emit` is already a `_NoRecursionMarker` instance.\n\n2. **Missing Instance Check**: The patch doesn't properly check if `emit` is an instance of `_NoRecursionMarker` before comparing. It should use `isinstance()` or compare the `event_src` attribute.\n\n3. **Redundant elif Branch**: The `elif emit:` branch at the end will never execute correctly because if `emit` is a `_NoRecursionMarker` instance, the first condition `emit and emit != _NoRecursionMarker(self)` will evaluate to `True` (since a new marker is created for comparison), causing the callbacks to be processed",
