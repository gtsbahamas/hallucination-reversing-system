No such image` indicates the test environment couldn't be set up, so we can't see if the patch logic was correct.\n\nHowever, examining the patch itself reveals a critical issue:\n\n**The bug in the previous patch:**\n```python\ndual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n                             dual_coef_indices.size // n_class)\n```\n\nThe change from `/` to `//` (integer division) is correct for avoiding the ZeroDivisionError, but there's a subtle problem: when `n_SV > 0`, the step size `dual_coef_indices.size // n_class` equals `n_SV`, which creates the wrong indptr array structure.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe original code had:\n```python\ndual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,\n             ",
