      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I can identify the problem with the previous patch:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. The patch added an `exp` parameter to `_print_SingularityFunction()` and used `_do_exponent()` to wrap the result\n2. However, `_do_exponent()` adds parentheses around the entire expression: `\\left(...\\right)^{exp}`\n3. This creates **nested parentheses** because `_print_SingularityFunction` already wraps its output in `\\left\\langle ... \\right\\rangle^{power}`\n4. The result would be: `\\left({\\left\\langle shift \\right\\rangle}^{power}\\right)^{exp}` which is incorrect LaTeX formatting\n\n**The real issue:**\n\nWhen `_print_Pow` encounters `SingularityFunction(L, 0, 0)**2`, it calls:\n```python\nself._print(expr.base, exp=self._print(expr.exp))\n```\n\nThis passes the exponent `exp='2'` to `_print_SingularityFunction`, expecting it to handle the exponent directly in its output, not wrap it again.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. Keep the `exp` parameter in",

However, the test failed due to an infrastructure error (Docker image not found), not a logic error. But there's still a conceptual issue with the implementation:\n\n1. The patch wraps the entire singularity function in parentheses when `exp` is provided, but this creates redundant wrapping since the singularity function already uses `\\left\\langle ... \\right\\rangle` brackets.\n\n2. The real issue is in `_print_Pow()` at line 651 in `latex.py`:\n   ```python\n   return self._print(expr.base, exp=self._print(expr.exp))\n   ```\n   This passes `exp` as a keyword argument to ANY function's print method when the base is a Function. But `_print_SingularityFunction()` didn't accept this parameter, causing the TypeError.\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\nThe fix should:\n1. Accept ",
