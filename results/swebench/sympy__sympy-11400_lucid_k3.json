However, reviewing the patch itself reveals a potential problem:\n\n**The patch imports are inside the method**, which is inefficient and non-standard for the codebase. More importantly, **the method name `_print_sinc` doesn't match the actual function class name** that SymPy uses.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. SymPy's `sinc` function is likely defined as a class (probably `sinc` in lowercase)\n2. The printer method naming convention is `_print_<ClassName>`\n3. Looking at the existing code, functions like `sign` have a `_print_sign` method\n4. The sinc function should be converted to a Piecewise expression: `sin(x)/x` when `x \u2260 0`, else `1`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Verify the correct class name**: The function is likely `sinc` (lo",

While `S` might be available in the module scope, it's not explicitly imported in the method.\n\n2. **Imports inside method**: The patch imports modules inside the `_print_sinc` method, which is inefficient and not following the pattern of other methods in the class.\n\n3. **Potential issue with `sinc` import**: The method is named `_print_sinc` but doesn't import the `sinc` function itself, which might be needed for proper handling.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach should:\n\n1. **Import at module level**: Move the necessary imports to the top of the file wher",
