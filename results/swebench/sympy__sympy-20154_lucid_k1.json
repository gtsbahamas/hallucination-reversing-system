However, the test infrastructure failed with a Docker image error, so we can't see if the actual fix works. But looking at the patch more carefully, I notice:\n\n1. The patch modified the docstring to remove the warning about dictionary reuse\n2. It changed one doctest from showing the buggy behavior to `# doctest: +SKIP`\n3. It added `.copy()` in two places where dictionaries are yielded\n\n**The core issue:**\n\nThe docstring changes are incomplete. The original docstring had:\n```python\n>>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]\n[{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]\n```\n\nThis shows the buggy behavior (all dicts are the same object). The patch changed the later example to `# doctest: +SKIP` but didn't fix this earlier example.\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Remove or ",
