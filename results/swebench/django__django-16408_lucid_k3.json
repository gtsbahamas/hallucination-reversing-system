      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and what the correct fix should be.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue occurs when using multi-level `FilteredRelation` with `select_related()`. The problem is in how Django sets up the relationship between fetched objects.\n\n### What the Previous Patch Did Wrong\n\nThe previous patch changed the condition from `len(joins) <= 2` to `len(joins) == 2`. This is **too restrictive** because:\n\n1. When `len(joins) == 2`, it uses the `local_setter`\n2. When `len(joins) != 2` (including `len(joins) < 2`), it uses `no_local_setter`\n\nThis breaks cases where `len(joins) < 2`, which are valid scenarios that need the local setter.\n\n### Key Insights from the Issue Description\n\nFrom the hint in the issue:\n> \"The type of the first argument of the local_setter should be joins[-2], but query do not fetch that object, so no available local_setter when len(joins) > 2.\"\n\nThe critical insight is:\n- `local_setter` expects to set ",
