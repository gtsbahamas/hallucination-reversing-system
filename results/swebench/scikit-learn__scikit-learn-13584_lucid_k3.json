This means parameters that ARE equal to defaults will still be added if the comparison raises an exception.\n\n2. **Overly broad exception handling**: The `except (ValueError, TypeError)` catches comparison failures and treats them as \"different from default\", which is incorrect. If a comparison fails, we should handle it more carefully.\n\n3. **Unnecessary complexity**: The patch tries `np.array_equal()` first, then falls back to `==`, but this creates confusing control flow with nested try-except blocks.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test output shows a Docker image build error, but the core issue from the bug report is clear: when co",
