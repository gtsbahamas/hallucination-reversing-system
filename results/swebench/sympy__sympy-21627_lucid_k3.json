      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Incorrect Logic Flow**\nThe previous patch added `if arg.is_extended_real: return` which causes the function to return `None` for real arguments. This breaks the expected behavior where `Abs` should still evaluate for real numbers (e.g., `Abs(-5)` should return `5`).\n\n### 2. **Misplaced Condition Check**\nThe check `if _arg not in (conj, -conj):` was placed too early, wrapping the entire `new_conj` logic block. This changes the control flow incorrectly - the condition should be checked AFTER we know we want to proceed with the `sqrt(arg*conj)` simplification.\n\n### 3. **Indentation Error**\nThe entire block after the new condition was indented, making it conditional on `_arg not in (conj, -conj)`, which inverts the intended logic.\n\n## Root Cause of Recursion\n\nThe recursion happens because:\n1. `Abs.eval()` computes `conj = conjugate(arg)`\n2. Then calls `signsimp(arg, eva",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Early return without value**: The patch added `return` statements without returning anything, which returns `None` implicitly. In SymPy's `eval` methods, returning `None` means \"don't evaluate, keep as-is\", but the code flow expects either a value or to continue processing.\n\n2. **Logic inversion**: The condition `if _arg not in (conj, -conj): return` is backwards. According to the hint, we should return (continue with sqrt computation) when `_arg` IS equal to `conj` or `-conj`, not when it's NOT equal.\n\n3. **Premature signsimp call**: The patch calls `signsimp` before checking if we should even be in this code path, and then doesn't use the original logic properly.\n\n4. **Variable confusion**: The patch creates `abs_free_arg_simplified` but the original logic needs to work with both the original `arg` and the `abs_free_arg` version.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nTh",
