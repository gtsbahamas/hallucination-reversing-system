The arguments are positional, and the order matters. The patch placed `--co` between `--collectonly` and `--collect-only`, but these should all be treated as alternative names for the same option.\n\n**Key insight from the error:**\nThe test failure shows a Docker image build error, which suggests the test environment couldn't be set up properly. However, the actual issue is likely that the option definition syntax is incorrect.\n\n**What needs to change:**\nIn pytest's `addoption()` method, all alternative names for an option should be passed as separate positional arguments at the beginning, before any keyword arguments. The current patch has:\n```python\ngroup.addoption(\n    \"--collectonly\",\n    \"--co\",\n    \"--collect-only\",\n    action=\"store_true\",\n    ",
