The problem is that some database backends (particularly PostgreSQL) cannot perform `DISTINCT` on certain custom field types that don't support comparison operations.\n\n## Key Insights from Issue History\n\n1. **Original fix was reverted**: The `.distinct()` approach was tried in [15607] but reverted in [15791] due to breaking custom fields\n2. **Alternati",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect `__len__` implementation**: The patch added a `__len__` method that returns `len(self.queryset) + (1 if self.field.empty_label is not None else 0)`. This is problematic because:\n   - It doesn't account for duplicates that will be filtered out in `__iter__`\n   - The queryset length includes duplicates, but `__iter__` filters them, causing a mismatch\n   - This breaks any code that relies on `len()` matching the actual number of items yielded\n\n2. **Performance issue**: The patch iterates through the entire queryset to check for duplicates, but doesn't optimize the query itself. Each `obj.pk` access still requires the full object to be loaded.\n\n3. **Test failure**: The error shows the Docker image wasn't found, but the underlying issue is that the `__len__` method creates an inconsistency between the reported length and actual iteration cou",
