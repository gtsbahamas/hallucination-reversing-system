However, the test `test_excinfo_repr_str` is failing, which suggests it expects specific behavior from both `__repr__` and `__str__`.\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. The test name `test_excinfo_repr_str` indicates it tests both `repr()` and `str()` behavior\n2. The issue discussion concluded that deleting `__str__` is the right approach, but there must be a test that needs updating\n3. The current `__str__` implementation returns a formatted string like `\"<console>:3: LookupError: A\"` which is confusing\n4. After deletion, `str(e)` should fall back to `__repr__`, which returns something like `\"<ExceptionInfo LookupError tblen=10>\"`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe patch itself is correct - we should delete the `__str__` method.

The error indicates a Docker image build failure, which suggests the test modifications were problematic.\n\nLooking at the previous patch:\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to modify `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` with specific assertions about file paths and line numbers that are environment-dependent\n2. The test expectations included hardcoded paths like `<Testdir local('/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-current/test_excinfo_repr_str0')>` which won't work across different environments\n3. The regex pattern `re.match(r\"<ExceptionInfo CustomException tblen=\\d+>\", str(excinfo))` was added but the test file may not have had the proper imports or structure\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. The core change (removing `__str__` method from `ExceptionInfo`) is correct\n2. The test modifications need to be",
