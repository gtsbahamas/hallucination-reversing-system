      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to a **malformed patch format** - it ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. Looking at the patch structure, the issue is in the `requests/models.py` section where the patch appears incomplete.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incomplete patch**: The patch for `requests/models.py` is truncated - it adds the try-except block for `LocationParseError` but doesn't show the complete context after the exception handling\n2. **Missing closing logic**: The patch shows adding a try-except around `parse_url()` but the subsequent code flow is cut off\n3. **Line ending issue**: The error \"patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line\" indicates the diff wasn't properly terminated\n\n## Key Insights from Issue\n\nFrom the stack traces and discussion:\n1. **DecodeError** - leaks through when reading response content with gzip encoding\n2. **TimeoutError** - should already be caught but may leak in edge cases  \n3. **ClosedPoolError** - leaks when using Session in m",
