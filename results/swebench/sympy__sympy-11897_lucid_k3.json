This would cause a syntax error.\n\n2. **Incorrect logic for detecting fractions**: The check `arg.is_Rational and arg.q != 1` is flawed because:\n   - It checks individual args, but a rational coefficient like `1/2` in `1/(x+y)/2` is represented as `Rational(1,2)` multiplied with `1/(x+y)`\n   - The expression `1/(x+y)/2` is actually `Mul(Rational(1,2), Pow(Add(x,y), -1))`\n\n3. **Missing the core issue**: The problem is that `fraction()` is being called unconditionally on ALL `Mul` expressions, which converts things like `exp(-x)*log(x)` into `log(x)/exp(x)` even when there's no actual division in the original expression.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test infrastructure failed to build, but based on the is",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Logic Error**: The patch only checks for `Pow` objects with negative exponents as *direct arguments* of `Mul`, but this misses cases like `1/(x+y)/2` where the structure is `Mul(Rational(1,2), Pow(x+y, -1))`. The `Pow` with negative exponent IS a direct argument.\n\n2. **Incomplete Condition**: The condition `has_pow_with_neg_exp` doesn't properly distinguish between cases where we want fraction form vs. cases where we don't. For example:\n   - `exp(-x)*log(x)` should NOT use fraction (exp(-x) should stay as is)\n   - `1/(x+y)/2` SHOULD use fraction (to get proper denominator)\n\n3. **Missing Key Insight**: The real issue is that `fraction()` is being too aggressive. It converts `exp(-x)` into `1/exp(x)` because it sees the negative exponent inside the exponential function. We need to prevent `fraction()` from \"reaching inside\" function arguments.\n\n## ",
