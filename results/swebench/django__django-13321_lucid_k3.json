This means we can't determine if the patch logic was correct.\n\nLooking at the original issue more carefully:\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch:\nThe patch only moved `base64.b64decode()` inside the try block, but this is **incomplete**. The issue shows that when invalid session data is encountered, the exception chain is:\n1. `BadSignature` from `signing.loads()` in `decode()`\n2. Falls back to `_legacy_decode()`\n3. `binascii.Error: Incorrect padding` from `base64.b64decode()`\n\nThe previous patch would catch the `binascii.Error`, but the broader exception handler catches **all** exceptions and returns an empty dict `{}`.
