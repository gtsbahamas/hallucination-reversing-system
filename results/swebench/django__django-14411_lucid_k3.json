      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and what the actual problem is.\n\n## Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe problem is that `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` renders non-labelable content (just text), but Django's form rendering system generates a `<label>` element with a `for` attribute pointing to a widget ID. Since there's no input element to associate with, the `for` attribute is invalid HTML.\n\n## What Was Wrong with the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch added:\n```python\ndef id_for_label(self, id_):\n    return None\n```\n\nThis approach is correct in principle - when `id_for_label()` returns `None`, Django's form rendering should not add a `for` attribute to the label. However, the test failed due to an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not because the fix was wrong.\n\n## The Correct Fix\n\nThe previous patch was actually on the right track. The `id_for_label()` method is used by Django's `BoundField` class to determine what value to use for t",

When a widget's `id_for_label()` returns `None`, Django's form rendering should not include the `for` attribute in the `<label>` tag.\n\n## Why the Previous Patch Should Work\n\nThe previous patch is actually **correct in approach**:\n\n1. **`id_for_label(self, id_)` returning `None`** is the Django convention for widgets that shouldn't have a label association\n2.
