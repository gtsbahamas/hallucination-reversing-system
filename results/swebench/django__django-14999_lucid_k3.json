However, this is incomplete because:\n\n1. **It only handles the main table rename** - The code after the early return also handles:\n   - Altering fields pointing to the renamed model (foreign keys)\n   - Renaming M2M tables and columns based on the model name\n\n2. **The issue states the problem clearly**: In PostgreSQL, it \"drops and recreates foreign key constraints\" even when `db_table` is set. This means the foreign key alteration logic is still running when it shouldn't.\n\n3. **The early return prevents ALL operations**, but we need to be more selective. When `db_table` is explicitly set and doesn't change, we should skip:\n   - The main table rename (`alter_db_table`)\n   - But we might still need to handle related field updates if they ",

The early return should happen BEFORE any name swapping, but the indentation and placement were wrong.\n\n### Issue 2: Missing Check Condition\nThe patch checks if `old_model._meta.db_table == new_model._meta.db_table`, but this only catches cases where the db_table is explicitly the same. The real issue is that when `db_table` is explicitly set in the model's Meta options, renaming the model shouldn't affect the database table at all - regardless of whether the table names happen to match.\n\n### Issue 3: Test Infrastructure Error\nThe test output shows a Docker image build error, not an actual test failure. However, we need to ensure the logic is correct.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen a model has `db_t",

It gets `to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.old_name)` when it should be getting `self.new_name` from `to_state` (since we're going backwards).\n\n2. **Redundant check**: The backwards method already calls `database_forwards` after swapping names, so adding a separate check creates duplicate logic and potential inconsistency.\n\n3. **Missing check for explicit `db_table` setting**: The patch only checks if the table names are equal, but doesn't verify that `db_table` was explicitly set in the model's Meta options.
