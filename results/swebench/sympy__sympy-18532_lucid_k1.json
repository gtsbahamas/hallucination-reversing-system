      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Duplicate \"Examples\" header**: The patch added a redundant `Examples` section header in the docstring, which is a documentation formatting error.\n\n2. **Test infrastructure failure**: The test results show a Docker image build failure (404 error), not an actual test failure. This means we can't see the real test output, but we need to anticipate what would fail based on the code changes.\n\n3. **Logic issue**: The patch correctly changes from checking `isinstance(expr, Atom)` to checking `not expr.args`, but there's a subtle problem with the implementation structure.\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFrom the issue discussion:\n- Objects like `BaseScalar` and `BaseVector` were previously included (as they were `Atom` subclasses) but had `.args`\n- The new behavior should include ANY object with no args, not just `Atom` subclasses\n- `Basic()` itself has no args and s",
