The patch tried to use `py.path.local()` to get the current working directory, but this creates a path object from the current directory\n2. It then tried to use `samefile()` to compare with `config.invocation_dir`\n3. The test failed with a Docker image error, but the underlying issue is that `config.invocation_dir` likely doesn't exist or isn't the right attribute to use\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. `config.invocation_dir` may not be the correct attribute - need to verify what attribute stores the initial directory\n2. The `samefile()` comparison approach is correct in principle but needs the right reference point\n3. Need to handle the case where paths might not exist or be comparable\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Find the correct initial directory reference**: Instead of `config.invocation_dir`, we should use `config.rootdir` or `conf",

The patch compared `py.path.local()` (current working directory) with `self.config.rootdir` (pytest's root directory)\n2. This comparison is flawed because:\n   - `rootdir` is the pytest project root (where pytest.ini/setup.py lives), not necessarily where pytest was invoked\n   - Even if the test changes to a subdirectory of rootdir, the comparison would fail\n   - The logic doesn't account for the actual relationship between paths\n\n**Key Insight from the Issue:**\nThe problem occurs when a fixture changes the working directory.
