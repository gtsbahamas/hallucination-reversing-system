The test failure (404 error for Docker image) suggests the tests couldn't even run, but based on the issue description and code analysis, the problem is:\n\n1. **The patch only handles `TypeSerializer`** - but the issue mentions that `EnumSerializer` was already fixed to use `__qualname__`, and there are other serializers that might need similar treatment.\n\n2. **More critically**: The patch changes the serialization for **all types**, including built-in types and types that should use `__name__`. The `__qualname__` attribute includes the full qualified name (e.g., `Outer.Inner`), which is correct for nested classes but may cause issues for:\n   - Top-level classes (where `__qualname__` == `__name",

The test failure indicates a Docker image issue, but the real problem is that the patch is too broad.\n\n**Key Issue:**\nNot all types have `__qualname__`. Built-in types like `int`, `str`, `float`, etc. only have `__name__`. The previous patch would fail when trying to serialize these types.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Use `__qualname__` conditionally**: Check if the type has `__qualname__` attribute before using it, falling back to `__name__` if not available.\n\n2. **Proper implementation**:\n   ```python\n   # In TypeSerializer.serialize():\n   if hasattr(self.value, \"__module__\"):\n       module = self.value.__module__\n       if module == builtins.__name__:\n        ",

However, based on the code and issue description, I can identify the likely problem:\n\nThe patch uses:\n```python\nname = getattr(self.value, '__qualname__', self.value.__name__)\n```\n\nThis is correct for getting the qualified name, but there's a subtle issue: `__qualname__` for nested classes includes the full path from the module level (e.g., `Outer.Inner`), which is exactly what we want.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **The patch itself is likely correct** - using `__qualname__` is the right approach for nested classes\n2. **The test failure is infrastructure-related** (Docker image not found), not a logic error\n3.
