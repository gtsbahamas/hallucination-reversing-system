However, I can analyze the previous patch and identify the issues based on the code structure and the requirements.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incomplete callable handling in FilePathField model**: The patch only modified the `_check_path()` method to skip validation for callables, but didn't handle callable evaluation in the model field's `__init__` method where `self.path` is actually used.\n\n2. **Missing callable handling in deconstruct()**: When migrations are generated, the `deconstruct()` method needs to serialize the callable properly (similar to how `FileField.upload_to` handles callables). The current patch doesn't address this.\n\n3. **Form field evaluation timing**: While the form field patch correctly evaluates the callable in `__init__`, the model field needs similar treatment.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n### Key Changes Needed\n\n1. **In `dja",

However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Redundant `_path` storage**\nThe patch stores `self._path = path` but then immediately overwrites `self.path = path`. This means `self.path` still gets the callable, which will cause issues when the path is used elsewhere in the code.\n\n### 2. **Missing callable evaluation in `__init__`**\nThe callable path should be evaluated and stored in `self.path` during initialization, not left as a callable. The original callable should be stored separately for deconstruction.\n\n### 3. **Incomplete `_check_path` logic**\nThe check `if self.path is None or callable(self.path):` allows callables to pass, but the rest of the validation logic still expects `self.path` to be a string.\n\n### 4. **Unnecessary `get_prep_value` override**\nThis method was added but doesn't serv",
