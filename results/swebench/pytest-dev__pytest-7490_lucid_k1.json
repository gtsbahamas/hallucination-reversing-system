      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch attempted to re-evaluate xfail marks during the `call` phase in `pytest_runtest_makereport`, but this approach has a critical flaw:\n\n**The patch only re-evaluates during `makereport`, which happens AFTER the test has already run.** The issue is that the xfail evaluation needs to happen BEFORE or DURING the test execution to properly handle the failure.\n\nLooking at the code flow:\n1. `pytest_runtest_setup` - evaluates xfail marks and stores in `xfailed_key`\n2. `pytest_runtest_call` - checks stored xfail, but doesn't re-evaluate for dynamically added markers\n3. Test executes and fails\n4. `pytest_runtest_makereport` - creates report, but by this time the test has already failed\n\nThe problem is in `pytest_runtest_call` - it retrieves the cached xfail evaluation from setup:\n```python\nxfailed = item._store.get(xfailed_key, None)\nif xfailed is None:\n    item._store[xfailed_key] = xfailed = evaluate_xfail_marks(item)\n",
