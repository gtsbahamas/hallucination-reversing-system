      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The previous patch removed the logic that tried to detect negative coefficients using `S(item.args[0]).is_negative`, which was causing the sympify error with `'y*'`\n2. However, it replaced it with a naive approach that **always** adds the delimiter between terms, even when a term already has a leading minus sign\n3. This means expressions like `x + (-y)` would print as `x (+) -y` instead of `x - y`\n\n**The core issue:**\nThe original code tried to use `sympify` on what it assumed was a coefficient string, but `item.args[0]` for a `MatrixSymbol('y*', n, n)` is the Symbol object itself with name `'y*'`, not a numeric coefficient. The `'y*'` string can't be parsed by sympify.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure is actually a Docker image issue, not a test logic failure. However, the conceptual problem remains: the patch doesn't properly ha",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Wrong approach to detecting negative coefficients**\nThe previous patch used `_coeff_isneg(expr.args[i])` which is designed for `Add` expressions with numeric coefficients. However, `MatAdd` contains matrix expressions, not simple numeric terms. This function doesn't work correctly for matrix expressions.\n\n### 2. **Incorrect indexing**\nThe loop uses `enumerate(pforms[1:], 1)` and then accesses `expr.args[i]`, but the enumeration starts at 1 while iterating over `pforms[1:]`, causing an off-by-one error in accessing `expr.args`.\n\n### 3. **Missing negative sign handling**\nWhen a term is negative, the patch just adds a space but doesn't actually print the negative sign. The negative sign should be part of the printed form of the term itself.\n\n## Root Cause from Original Code\n\nThe original code tried to use `S(item.args[0]).is_negative` which:\n- Assumes `item`",
