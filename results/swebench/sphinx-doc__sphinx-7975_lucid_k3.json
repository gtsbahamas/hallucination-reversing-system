      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch inverted the logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` by changing:\n```python\nif lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n    lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n```\nto:\n```python\nif not (lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_')):\n    lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n```\n\nThis is **backwards**. The original logic was:\n- If the key starts with a letter or underscore \u2192 prepend `chr(127)` to sort it AFTER symbols\n- Otherwise (symbols) \u2192 leave as-is to sort BEFORE letters\n\nThe patch inverted this, which would make symbols sort after letters instead of before them, breaking the intended behavior completely.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe real issue is in `keyfunc3`, which determines the grouping header. The problem occurs because:\n\n1. **Different symbols get different sort keys** in `keyfunc`:\n   - `@` (ASCII 64) stays as-is \u2192 sorts before letters\n   - `\u00a3` (Unicode 163) ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can see the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\nThe previous patch had the right idea but made a critical error:\n\n1. **Wrong condition check**: It checked `original_k.startswith('_')` but this doesn't help distinguish between underscore entries that should be letters vs symbols\n2. **Logic flaw**: The condition `if letter.isalpha() or original_k.startswith('_')` would make ALL underscore entries go into the letter section, but the issue shows that `_` entries should be in Symbols\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe problem is in the `keyfunc` function (line ~115) and `keyfunc3` function (line ~140):\n\n1. In `keyfunc`, entries starting with `_` are treated as letters: `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'): lckey = chr(127) + lckey`\n2. This causes `_` entries to sort AFTER regular letters (chr(127) is DEL character, sorts after letters)\n3. In `keyfunc3`, the grouping logic checks `if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_'` which ",

      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the \"two Symbols sections\" issue by removing the special handling of underscore (`_`) characters. However, this approach failed the test because it was too simplistic.\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch\n\nThe patch removed `or lckey.startswith('_')` and `or letter == '_'` conditions, which means:\n1. Entries starting with `_` are no longer sorted to the end (after letters)\n2. Entries starting with `_` are now classified as \"Symbols\" instead of being treated as a letter category\n\nThis breaks the expected behavior where underscore-prefixed entries should be treated specially (likely as their own category or grouped with letters).\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is that the code has **inconsistent logic** for determining what constitutes a \"Symbol\":\n\n1. In `keyfunc()` (line 107): Symbols are entries where the first character is NOT alphabetic AND does NOT start with `_`\n2. In `keyfunc2()` (line 137): Same logic - prepends chr(127",
