      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, it seems there was an infrastructure issue with the Docker image, not a test failure from the code change itself. However, let me analyze the previous patch attempt and provide a better solution.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to add special handling for Float comparisons within `_eval_evalf`, checking if Floats have the same precision and are equal\n2. This approach was overly complex and added redundant logic\n3. The simpler change of replacing `_aresame` with `!=` comparison was actually on the right track, but may have caused other issues\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\nThe core issue is that `_aresame` uses object identity (`is`) to check if args changed, which fails for Float objects that are numerically equal but different instances. When `evalf(5)` is called:\n- `expr1.evalf(5)` creates Float objects for the exponent 2.5\n- `expr2.evalf(5)` creates different Float objects for the same exponent 2.5\n- These Floats have identica",

      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to understand what went wrong with the previous patch and why the test failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is that `expr1.evalf(5) - expr2.evalf(5)` doesn't simplify to 0, even though the floating point representations are identical. The expressions are:\n- `expr1 = 0.5*x**2.5`\n- `expr2 = 0.5*x**2.5`\n\nThey look the same but don't compare as equal after `evalf(5)`.\n\n## What the Previous Patch Did Wrong\n\nThe previous patch changed `_aresame()` checks to simple `!=` comparisons:\n```python\nif tuple(args) != tail_args:  # was: if not _aresame(tuple(args), tail_args):\n```\n\n**The problem**: Using `!=` for tuple comparison will use Python's default equality, which for SymPy objects calls `__eq__`, which returns a symbolic equality (like `Eq(x, y)`), not a boolean. This breaks the conditional logic.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Failure\n\nThe test failure shows a Docker image issue, but the real problem is that the patch breaks the fundamental comparison logi",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to fix Float comparison by checking `_mpf_` equality in `_args_equal`\n2. However, the test results show a Docker image build error, not a test failure - this suggests the patch may have syntax/import issues\n3. More critically, the approach is flawed: comparing `_mpf_` tuples directly won't solve the root issue because the problem is that `_aresame` is being used to determine if reconstruction is needed, but it's too strict for Floats with the same value\n\n**The Real Problem:**\nFrom the hints, we see that:\n- `expr1.evalf(5)` and `expr2.evalf(5)` have identical `_mpf_` representations\n- But `_aresame` returns False for them (likely due to object identity checks)\n- This causes `_eval_evalf` to unnecessarily reconstruct the expression instead of returning `self`\n- The reconstruction creates new Float objects that don't simplify to zero\n\n*",
