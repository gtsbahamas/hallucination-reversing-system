      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to use negative lookbehind `(?<!\\{)` and negative lookahead `(?!\\})` to avoid matching double braces `{{` and `}}`. However, this approach has a critical flaw:\n\n**The Problem:** The regex `(?<!\\{)\\{(.+?)(:.*)?\\}(?!\\})` will still match the inner braces in `{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}` because:\n1. When it encounters `{{ \"Category\"`, the second `{` is not preceded by another `{` (the first `{` is before it, but we're looking at position of second `{`)\n2. It matches `{ \"Category\"` as a potential format field\n3. Similarly, it tries to match other parts incorrectly\n\nThe test failure (404 error for Docker image) suggests the patch broke the build/test infrastructure, likely due to syntax issues or the regex not working as intended.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue is that Python's `str.format()` method treats `{{` as an escaped `{` (literal brace), but ",

The patch correctly identified that escaped braces (`{{` and `}}`) need special handling to avoid being matched by the regex\n2. However, it made a critical mistake: it modified `template_for_parsing` during the loop but then restored the original `template` from the modified `template_for_parsing`\n3. This means when invalid arguments are found and removed from `template_for_parsing`, those removals get carried over to the final `template`, which is incorrect\n4. The original `template` should be preserved as-is for the final output - we only want to parse it differently to avoid false warnings\n\n**The core issue:**\n\nThe regex `r\"\\{(.+?)(:.*)?\\}\"` matches `{` followed by content, treating `{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}` as containing the argument `{ \"Category\"` because after the first `{` is consumed, the next `{` starts a new potential match.\n\n## Fi",
