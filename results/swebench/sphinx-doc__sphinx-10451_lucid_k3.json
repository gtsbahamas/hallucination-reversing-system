The annotations dict keys are the actual parameter names WITHOUT asterisks (e.g., `'args'`, `'kwargs'`), but the field names in the docstring have asterisks (e.g., `'*args'`, `'**kwargs'`).\n\n3. **Mismatch in tracking**: The code tracks parameters by their stripped names in the `arguments` dict, but when it adds new fields, it needs to match the original field name format (with asterisks).\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nThe issue is that:\n- Napoleon convert",
