      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to a **malformed patch format** - it ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. This is a formatting issue, not a logic problem.\n\nHowever, looking at the logic itself, there's a **critical bug** in the previous patch:\n\n```python\nif year - current_year > 50:\n    year += 1900\n```\n\nThis is **incorrect**. When a year is more than 50 years in the future, we should **subtract 100 years**, not add 1900. The current logic would:\n- Add the current century to the 2-digit year\n- Then if it's >50 years in future, add 1900 (which makes no sense)\n\nFor example, if current year is 2020 and we parse \"71\":\n- `year = 71 + 2000 = 2071` (71 years in future)\n- Since `2071 - 2020 = 51 > 50`, it would do `year += 1900 = 3971` \u274c\n\n## Correct Fix Plan\n\nThe logic should be:\n\n1. **Add current century** to the 2-digit year\n2. **If result is >50 years in the future**, subtract 100 years to get the most recent past year with same last 2 di",
