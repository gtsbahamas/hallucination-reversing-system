      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch sorted by dictionary keys (degrees), but this doesn't match what the function is supposed to return. The `decompose()` function with `separate=True` should return a list of polynomial terms (the values), not sorted by their degree keys.\n\n**The real issue:**\nThe problem is that `dict.values()` returns values in arbitrary order (especially in Python < 3.7). The function needs to return values in a **deterministic order**, but sorting by degree keys isn't necessarily the right approach - it depends on what order the caller expects.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. Looking at the code context, `decompose()` is called in `polytope_integrate()`:\n   ```python\n   monoms = decompose(polys, separate=True)\n   for monom in monoms:\n   ```\n\n2. The function decomposes a polynomial into its constituent monomials grouped by degree. When `separate=True`, ",
