      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to **malformed diff formatting**. The issue is with the indentation in the diff - the `def _gather(c_powers):` line appears to have incorrect indentation markers in the patch.\n\nLooking at the patch structure:\n1. The helper function `_has_infinity` was added correctly\n2. The logic to skip infinity-containing bases was added\n3. The logic to add back skipped powers was added at the end\n\nHowever, the diff format itself is broken - the indentation markers are inconsistent.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nFrom the issue description and hints:\n- When `r.subs(b,a)` is evaluated, it becomes `(1/(2*a) + zoo) / (1/(2*a) - zoo)`\n- Because `-zoo == zoo`, both numerator and denominator are treated as identical\n- The `_gather` function in `Mul.flatten` combines powers of the same base\n- `(zoo + x)^1 * (zoo + x)^(-1)` gets combined to `(zoo + x)^0 = 1`\n- This is incorrect because expressions containing infinity should not cancel this way\n\n#",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incomplete check**: The patch only checked if the *base* contains infinity using `_has_infinity(b)`, but the real issue is when the base contains infinity **and the exponents sum to zero** (causing cancellation). The patch prevented all combinations of infinity-containing bases, which is too broad.\n\n2. **Missing the core problem**: The issue occurs specifically when expressions like `(zoo + a)` and `(zoo - a)` are treated as having the same base and their exponents (1 and -1) are combined to give 0, resulting in `base**0 = 1`. The patch should prevent this specific cancellation, not all combinations.\n\n3. **Test failure context**: The Docker image build failure suggests environment issues, but the logic problem remains: we need to detect when combining exponents would result in cancellation (sum to 0) for bases containing infinity.\n\n## Key Insights ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the failed patch, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect infinity detection**: The patch used `b.has(S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity, S.ComplexInfinity)` which checks if the base contains these as subexpressions, but this is too broad and may not work correctly for all cases.\n\n2. **Wrong condition check**: The patch only checked `combined_exp.is_zero`, but the real issue is when powers cancel (e.g., `(zoo+a)^1 * (zoo+a)^(-1)` \u2192 `(zoo+a)^0`). The check should happen when we're about to combine exponents that would result in cancellation.\n\n3. **Missing the root cause**: The issue states that `(zoo + a) / (zoo + a)` returns 1 because `-zoo` is the same as `zoo`, so `(zoo - a)` becomes `(zoo + a)`. The patch doesn't address this fundamental problem in the gathering logic.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test output shows a Docker image build error, which means the patch couldn't even be tested.
