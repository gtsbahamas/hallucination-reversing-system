This is a fundamental mismatch.\n\n2. **Wrong approach with Rectangle**: Using `Rectangle` and then calling `set_xy()` to override its vertices defeats the purpose of using Rectangle and creates confusion about what coordinate system is being used.\n\n3. **Manual vertex setting conflicts**: The `set_xy()` calls after creating the Rectangle override the Rectangle's internal geometry, breaking its update mechanisms.\n\n4. **Missing `_interpolation_steps`**: The original code set `self.poly.get_path()._interpolation_steps = 100` which was removed, potentially affecting rendering.\n\n### Root Cause from Issue\n\nThe real problem is that `axhspan`/`axvspa",

However, I can analyze the patch itself to identify issues:\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Missing import**: The patch adds `Polygon` to the imports but doesn't verify if this is the correct approach for the widget system.\n\n2. **Hardcoded coordinates**: The patch creates polygon vertices with hardcoded coordinates (`.25`, `.75`) which may not respect the axes coordinate system properly.\n\n3. **Lost functionality**: By replacing `axhspan`/`axvspan` with manual `Polygon` creation, the patch may lose important coordinate transformation and clipping behavior that these helper functions provide.\n\n4. **Incomplete attribute handling**: The patch conditionally checks for `_interpolation_steps` attribute, but this may not be the right approach.\n\n5. **Root cause not addressed**: The real issue is that `axhspan`/`axvspan` creates 4 vert",

The test infrastructure couldn't find the required Docker image. However, we can still analyze the patch for correctness.\n\n### Issues with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Incomplete fix**: The patch adds vertices to make the polygon have 5 points when it starts with 4, but then the `set_val` method still tries to set `xy[4]` which would work. However, it **removes the `xy[4]` assignments** in `set_val`, which is inconsistent with ensuring the polygon has 5 vertices.\n\n2. **Logic contradiction**: \n   - The patch ensures the polygon has 5 vertices in `__init__`\n   - But then removes the code that sets `xy[4]` in `set_val`\n   - This means after the first `set_val` call, the polygon would only have 4 vertices again (since `self.poly.xy = xy` replaces the entire array)\n\n3. **The real problem**: When `valinit[0] == valinit[1]`, `axhspan`/`axvspan` creates a degene",
