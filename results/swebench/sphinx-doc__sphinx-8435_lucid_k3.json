      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe test failed due to an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not because of the patch logic itself. However, looking at the previous patch attempt, I can identify several issues:\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Duplicate/conflicting changes**: The patch shows the same section being modified twice with slightly different approaches, creating conflicts\n2. **Incorrect `restify()` signature**: The patch attempts to pass `autodoc_type_aliases` as a second parameter to `restify()`, but we need to verify if `restify()` actually accepts this parameter\n3. **Unnecessary variable renaming**: Creating `objpath_key` and `objtype_raw` variables doesn't add value\n\n### Key Insights:\n\nLooking at the imports at the top of the file:\n```python\nfrom sphinx.util.typing import restify\n```\n\nThe issue states that `autodoc_type_aliases` should affect variables and attributes. The `get_type_hints()` call already receives `self.config.autodoc_type_aliases` as the third parame",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch attempted to pass `type_aliases` as a parameter to the `restify()` function, but `restify()` doesn't accept a `type_aliases` parameter. The function signature in `sphinx/util/typing.py` shows that `restify()` only takes the type annotation object itself, not any configuration for type aliases.\n\n**The real issue:**\nThe problem is that `get_type_hints()` is being called with `autodoc_type_aliases` to resolve the type aliases, but the resulting type object still contains the original unresolved type reference. The `restify()` function then converts this unresolved type to a string without applying the aliases.\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\nLooking at the code flow:\n1. `get_type_hints()` is called with `self.config.autodoc_type_aliases` \n2. This should resolve `String` to `example.MyString` in the type hints\n3. But the annotati",
