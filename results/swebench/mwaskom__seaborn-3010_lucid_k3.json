      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe previous patch correctly filtered out missing data using a mask, but it has a critical flaw: it filters the data **before** checking if there are enough unique values, but then uses the **filtered** data to create the polynomial fit while the gridsize calculation (`np.linspace(x.min(), x.max(), self.gridsize)`) also uses the filtered data. However, the main issue is that the patch is incomplete - it doesn't handle the case where after filtering, there might not be enough data points.\n\n**However, the actual test failure is different** - the test results show a Docker image build error, not a test execution failure. This suggests the patch may have syntax issues or the test environment couldn't be set up. But looking at the patch itself, I can see it's incomplete.\n\n## The Real Issues\n\n1. **The patch is incomplete** - it only shows partial chan",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch correctly identified the need to filter out missing data before calling `np.polyfit()`, but the test infrastructure failed due to a Docker image issue, not because of the patch logic itself. However, reviewing the patch more carefully, there's a subtle issue:\n\n**Problem with the previous patch:**\nThe patch filters the data using a boolean mask, but when working with pandas Series, this creates a new Series with a potentially non-contiguous index. While this works for `np.polyfit()`, it could cause issues if the filtered Series are empty or have other edge cases.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Missing data handling**: The core issue is that `np.polyfit()` cannot handle NaN values, which causes the `LinAlgError`\n2. **The previous patch was on the right track** but needs refinement\n3. **Edge case**: After filtering, we need to ensure there's still enough data",
