When Python sees `NotImplemented`, it will try the reflected operation on the right operand (`Exists.__rand__`), but `Exists` doesn't have `__rand__` or `__ror__` methods defined.\n\n## The Correct",

This is backwards - when `Q() & Exists()` is evaluated and `Q.__and__` returns `NotImplemented`, Python calls `Exists.__rand__(Q())`, which should combine with `Q` on the LEFT, not right.\n\n2. **The `_combine` signature mismatch**: `Combinable._combine(other, connector)` expects `other` to be a `Combinable`, but when `__rand__` receives a `Q` object, it's not a `Combinable` - it's a `Q` object. The method needs to handle this case.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test output shows a Docker image build error, which suggests the patch may have syntax issues or the test environment failed to build.

When Python calls `__rand__`, the `self` is the RIGHT operand (Exists) and `other` is the LEFT operand (Q). The current implementation does `self._combine(other, ...)` which would try to combine from Exists's perspective, but `Combinable._combine` expects both operands to be Combinable instances.\n\n2. **Missing type checking**: The `__rand__` and `__ror__` methods don't verify that `other` is a Q instance before attempting to combine.\n\n3. **Wrong combination direction**: When `Q() & Exists()` fails in `Q.__and__`, Python calls `Exists.__rand__(Q())`. At this point, we need to create a combination where Q is on the left and Exists is on the right, but we should let Q's logic handle it since Q has specia",
