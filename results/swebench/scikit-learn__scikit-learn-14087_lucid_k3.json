However, this approach has a critical flaw:\n\n**The issue is that `coefs_paths` has different shapes depending on whether it's a binary or multiclass problem, NOT based on the `multi_class` parameter alone.**\n\nLooking at the error and code:\n- When `refit=False`, the code tries to average coefficients across folds\n- The indexing `coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]` assumes 4D array (multinomial case)\n- The indexing `coefs_paths[i, best_indices[i], :]` assumes 3D array (binary case)\n- But the condition used (`multi_class == 'multinomial'`) doesn't correctly identify when `coefs_paths` is 3D vs 4D\n\n### Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure shows a Docker image build error, but the real issue is in the logic.

When `refit=False`, the code path doesn't actually refit the model, so it shouldn't be trying to compute averaged coefficients at all\n2. The patch still tries to compute `w` (averaged coefficients) even when `refit=False`, which is conceptually wrong\n3. The reshaping logic `w = w[np.newaxis, :]` is a band-aid that doesn't address the root cause\n\n**Root Cause:**\nLooking at the code structure around line 2189-2194, this entire block is computing averaged coefficients across folds to set `self.coef_` and `self.intercept_`. When `refit=False`, we should **skip this entire coefficient averaging section** because:\n- We're not refitting, so we shouldn't be setting final model coefficients\n- The `coefs_paths",

The code should:\n- Always compute `self.C_` (the selected regularization parameters)\n- Only set `self.coef_` and `self.intercept_` when `refit=True`\n\n### 2. **Incorrect Condition for `fit_intercept` Check**\nIn the original buggy code (line 2193-2194), there's a logic error:\n```python\nif self.fit_intercept:\n    self.coef_ = coefs_paths[0, 0, best_indices[0], :]\n    self.intercept_ = 0.\nelse:\n    w = np.mean([coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]\n                 for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)\n```\n\nThis is backwards!
