      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the issue by making the `fraction()` function recursively flatten nested `Mul` expressions. However, the test results show the patch failed to build/run properly.\n\nLooking at the test code added:\n```python\nassert sympify('ceiling(x-1/2)', evaluate=False) == ceiling(x + Mul(-1, Mul(1, Pow(2, -1, evaluate=False), evaluate=False), evaluate=False))\n```\n\nThis test is problematic because:\n1. It's trying to assert exact structural equality with a complex unevaluated expression\n2. The sympify result may not match this exact structure even if semantically correct\n3. The test is too brittle and implementation-dependent\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe real issue, as identified in the discussion, is that `Mul._eval_is_integer()` uses `fraction()` which doesn't handle unevaluated nested `Mul` expressions correctly. When `evaluate=False` is used, expressions like `Mul(-1, Mul(1, Pow(2, -1, evaluate=False), evaluate=False), evaluate=False",
