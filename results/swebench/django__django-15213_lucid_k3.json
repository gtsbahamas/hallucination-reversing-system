      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch tried to handle empty WhereNode cases but had **syntax errors** - there were duplicate `return '', []` statements\n2. The logic was too broad - it would affect ALL empty WhereNode cases, not just those in ExpressionWrapper annotations\n3. The condition checking `compiler.query.annotations` was added inconsistently and wouldn't properly target the specific issue\n\n**The Real Problem:**\nWhen `~Q(pk__in=[])` is used in an ExpressionWrapper:\n- `Q(pk__in=[])` gets optimized away (empty IN clause \u2192 no children in WhereNode)\n- The negation `~Q()` creates a negated WhereNode with no children\n- Current code returns `('', [])` for negated empty WhereNode\n- This produces invalid SQL: `SELECT AS \"foo\"` (missing the value before AS)\n\n**What the test output shows:**\nThe Docker build failed, so we didn't get to see test results, but the issue description clea",

      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and why the tests failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is that `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))` generates invalid SQL: `SELECT AS \"foo\" FROM \"table\"` (missing the value before `AS`).\n\nThe problem occurs in the `WhereNode.as_sql()` method when:\n1. A negated Q object with an empty condition (`~Q(pk__in=[])`) is processed\n2. The `children` list is empty after optimization\n3. The negated empty condition should evaluate to `TRUE` (since `NOT FALSE = TRUE`)\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch returned `'1', []` for negated empty conditions, which would generate `SELECT 1 AS \"foo\"`. However, the test failure suggests this approach has issues. Looking more carefully:\n\n1. The patch modified `WhereNode.as_sql()` to return `'1', []` for negated empty conditions\n2. But this is at the wrong level - `WhereNode` is used in WHERE clauses, not in SELECT expressions\n3. When used in an ",
