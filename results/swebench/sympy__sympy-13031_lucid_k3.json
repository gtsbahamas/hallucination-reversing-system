      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to a **malformed diff format**. The patch attempted to replace the `col_join` method with `_eval_col_join`, but the diff was incorrectly formatted - it had too many deletion lines without proper context, causing the patch tool to fail.\n\nLooking at the actual issue and the hints:\n1. The problem is that `SparseMatrix.hstack()` returns incorrect shapes for zero-row matrices\n2. The issue was already fixed for `Matrix` (dense matrices) but not for `SparseMatrix`\n3. The root cause is that `SparseMatrix` implements `col_join` directly instead of `_eval_col_join`\n4. When `hstack` is called, it uses `col_join`, which has special handling that doesn't work correctly with the common matrix API\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe previous patch had the right idea but wrong execution:\n\n1. **Remove the `col_join` method entirely** from `SparseMatrix` - it should not override the base class method\n2. **Implement `_eval_col_join` instead** - this is the proper hook th",

Renaming it to `_eval_col_join` (to be called by the base class)\n2. Using `_eval_row_insert` to do the actual work\n\n**What went wrong:**\nThe patch failed to build the Docker image, but more fundamentally, there's a logical issue. The patch calls `self._eval_row_insert(self.rows, other)`, but looking at the `_eval_row_insert` implementation in the code, it returns a **new matrix** - it doesn't modify `self` in place. This is correct behavior for `_eval_row_insert`, but the patch doesn't handle the return value properly.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the issue description and the hints:\n1. The problem is that `SparseMatrix.hstack` with zero-row matrices returns wrong column counts\n2. The issue mentions that `SparseMatrix` should implement `_eval_col_join` instead of `col_join`\n3.

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe patch only implemented `_eval_col_join` for `SparseMatrix`, but the issue is actually about `hstack` (horizontal stacking), not `vstack` (vertical stacking). The issue description shows:\n\n```python\nsy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape  # Returns (0, 3) instead of (0, 6)\n```\n\nThe problem is with **horizontal stacking** (`hstack`), which uses `row_join`, not `col_join`. The patch fixed the wrong operation.\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n\n1. The issue states: \"The problem is solved with Matrix but not SparseMatrix\" - meaning dense matrices work correctly after a previous fix\n2. The bisected commit (27e9ee425819fa09a4cbb8179fb38939cc693249) likely fixed dense matrices by implementing `_eval_row_join` \n3. The comment mentions: \"`SparseMatrix` should implement `_eval_col_join`. `col_join` should not be implemented. It is, and that is what `hs",
