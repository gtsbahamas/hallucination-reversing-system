      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect recursion**: The patch calls `self.domain.get_field()` when `self.domain.has_assoc_Field` is true, but then tries to clone the ring with this field domain. This creates issues because:\n   - For `ZZ[y]` (polynomial ring over integers with variable y), the domain is `ZZ`\n   - `ZZ.get_field()` returns `QQ` (rationals)\n   - But we need to convert the entire `ZZ[y]` to `QQ[y]`, not just change the base domain\n\n2. **Missing the core issue**: The problem is that when we have `ZZ[y]` and need to perform division that results in rational coefficients, we need the entire polynomial ring to be over `QQ`, not `ZZ`. The patch attempted to handle this but didn't properly convert the polynomial ring's domain.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure shows a Docker image build error, but the real issue is conceptual:\n- When `apart((x+y)/(2*x",

      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I can identify the core problem and why the previous patch failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is that `apart()` produces incorrect results when dealing with expressions containing symbolic coefficients. The root cause is in how polynomial domains are handled during partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Key Issue**: When we have an expression like `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` and call `apart(t)`, the polynomial division happens in the domain `ZZ[a]` (integers with parameter `a`). When division produces fractional coefficients (like `1/2`), these get truncated to 0 in `ZZ[a]`, leading to incorrect results.\n\n## Why the Previous Patch Failed\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix this in `PolynomialRing.get_field()` by:\n1. Checking if the base domain is `ZZ`\n2. Converting to `QQ` before creating the field\n\n**The problem**: This approach is too aggressive and breaks the fundamental structure of polynomial rings.
