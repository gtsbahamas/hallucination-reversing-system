However, I can analyze the code issues.\n\n2. **Brittle Type Checking**: The patch checks `field.__class__.__name__ == 'JSONField'` which is fragile and doesn't handle inheritance properly.\n\n3. **Module Path Checking**: Checking specific module paths is brittle and will break if Django's internal structure changes or if third-party packages provide JSONField implementations.\n\n4. **Incorrect Return Logic**: The patch returns `field.prepare_value(value)` directly, but `prepare_value()` is designed for form field preparation, not display. It may not return a properly formatted JSON string.\n\n5. **Missing Import**: The code doesn't import `json` module which would be needed for proper JSON serialization.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nBased on the issue description and hint",

At the time this code was written (Django 3.1), `models.JSONField` didn't exist in `django.db.models` - it only existed in `django.contrib.postgres.fields`\n2. The test infrastructure couldn't even build the Docker image, suggesting a fundamental import/compatibility issue\n3. The hint explicitly warns against this approach: \"based off the type name which is brittle and doesn't account for inheritance\"\n\n**Key Insights:**\n1. The issue description suggests using `field.prepare_value()` method instead of direct `json.dumps()`\n2. The hint mentions waiting for #12990 (which would add `django.db.models.JSONField`), but we need a solution that works now\n3.
