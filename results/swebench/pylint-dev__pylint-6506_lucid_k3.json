      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the traceback issue by replacing the `raise _UnrecognizedOptionError` with `sys.exit(32)`. However, the tests are still failing because they expect the `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception to be raised so they can catch and verify it.\n\nLooking at the test requirements and the issue description, the problem is clear:\n1. The traceback should not be printed to users (user-facing behavior)\n2. But the exception should still be raised internally for testing purposes\n3. The exception needs to be caught at a higher level where it can be handled gracefully\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Wrong location for the fix**: The patch modified the wrong place. The exception should still be raised in `config_initialization.py` for internal consistency and testing.\n\n2. **Exception should be caught higher up**: Looking at the traceback in the issue, the exception bubbles up to `pylint/lint/run.py` in the `__init__` method. That's where it should be caught and handle",

The patch catches `_UnrecognizedOptionError` in `run.py` and exits with code 32\n2. However, the error message is already added by `_config_initialization` before the exception is raised\n3. The issue is that the exception itself is being raised and propagating up, causing a traceback to be printed\n\n**The real problem:**\nIn `config_initialization.py` lines 82-85, when unrecognized options are found:\n```python\nif unrecognized_options:\n    msg = \", \".join(unrecognized_options)\n    linter.add_message(\"unrecognized-option\", line=0, args=msg)\n    raise _UnrecognizedOptionError(options=unrecognized_options)  # This causes traceback\n```\n\nThe exception is raised AFTER adding the message, which causes the traceback to be printed to stderr before the catch block in `run.py` can handle it gracefully.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Solution:** Don't raise the exception at all i",

The patch called `linter.generate_reports()` before exiting, but this is problematic because:\n   - The linter hasn't actually run on any files yet (it's still in configuration phase)\n   - Generating reports at this point doesn't make sense and likely causes issues\n   - The test failure (404 image error) suggests the test environment couldn't even build, possibly due to the patch breaking the initialization flow\n\n2. The patch exits with code 32, which is correct, but the approach of generating reports is fundamentally flawed for this stage of execution.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **The issue is about presentation, not functionality**: The unrecognized option is correctly detected and a message is added via `linter.add_message()`. The problem is that `_UnrecognizedOptionError` is raised, causing a traceback.\n\n2. **The message is already added**: Before the ",
