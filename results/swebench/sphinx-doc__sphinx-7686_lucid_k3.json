      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch only filtered `ns['members']` based on `__module__` attribute matching `obj.__name__`\n2. This approach is too restrictive - it filters out built-in module attributes like `__builtins__`, `__cached__`, `__doc__`, `__file__`, etc. that don't have a `__module__` attribute or have it set to something other than the module name\n3. These built-in attributes are NOT imported members - they're intrinsic to the module itself\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nThe problem is specifically about imported members like `os` in the example. The member `os` has `__module__ = 'os'` while the module being documented is `example`, so `os.__module__ != 'example'.__name__`.\n\n**What needs to change:**\nThe logic should be inverted - we should EXCLUDE members where:\n- They have a `__module__` attribute AND\n- That `__module__` attribute is different from the current m",
