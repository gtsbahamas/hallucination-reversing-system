      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and what the actual problem is.\n\n## Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe core problem is that when a field is renamed from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField **with the same name**, Django's migration autodetector generates operations in the wrong order:\n\n1. `AddField` (the new M2M field)\n2. `AlterUniqueTogether` (removing the constraint)\n3. `RemoveField` (the old FK field)\n\nThis causes an error because when `AlterUniqueTogether` tries to remove the constraint, the field `project_data_set` it references has already been replaced by the M2M field (which doesn't support unique_together).\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to add a `references_field` attribute to the `AlterUniqueTogether` operation to create a dependency on field removals. However, this approach has several issues:\n\n1. **Wrong logic**: It iterates over `old_unique_together - new_unique_together` (which gives tuples ",
