However, `analyzer.attr_docs` uses `(namespace, name)` tuples where namespace is the qualname and name is just the attribute name.\n\n2. **Wrong lookup in `analyzer.tagorder`**: The code checks if the key exists in `analyzer.tagorder`, but should be checking `analyzer.attr_docs` directly since that's where the docstrings are stored.\n\n3. **Redundant docstring extraction**: The code tries to extract docstring from `analyzer.attr_docs` using a malformed key, when it should use the simple `(qualname, name)` tuple format.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure appears to be an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), but the logic error is clear from c",

This is problematic because:\n   - `qualname` is set once per `cls` in the MRO\n   - When processing annotations from a parent class (e.g., `Foo`), we're using `Foo`'s qualname\n   - But when looking up `analyzer.attr_docs`, we need to use the correct qualname for where the annotation was actually defined\n\n2. **The core issue**: When `Bar` inherits from `Foo`, and we iterate through the MRO:\n   - We process `Bar` first (cls=Bar, qualname='Bar')\n   - Then we process `Foo` (cls=Foo, qualname='Foo')\n   - When we find `attr1` annotation in `Foo`, we look it up with `qualname='Foo'`\n   - But the docstring lookup `analyzer.attr_docs.get((qualname, n",
