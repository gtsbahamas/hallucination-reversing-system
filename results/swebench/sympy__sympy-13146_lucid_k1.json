      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can see the issue:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to add `evaluate=True` to the `self.func(*args)` call in `_eval_evalf`:\n\n```python\nreturn self.func(*args, evaluate=True)\n```\n\nHowever, this failed because **`evaluate=True` is already the default behavior** when not explicitly set to `False`. The real problem is more subtle.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nFrom the issue description and hints:\n1. The floating point representations are **identical** at the MPF level\n2. It works with default precision but fails with `evalf(5)`\n3. After `evalf(5)`, we get `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` that doesn't simplify to 0\n\nThe issue is that `_eval_evalf` reconstructs the expression but **doesn't ensure the args are properly canonicalized for comparison**. When `self.func(*args)` is called, even though `evaluate=True` is the default, the `flatten` method may not be recognizing the terms as identical because of how the evalf'd numbers are be",
