      "remediation": "Looking at the test results, the patch failed to apply because of formatting issues. The patch had:\n1. A malformed line ending\n2. Incorrect line numbers (the hunk failed at line 1945)\n\nLet me analyze what went wrong:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch had formatting issues - it ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line\n2. The line numbers in the hunk header (1940, 1945) may not match the actual file\n3. The diff format was malformed with incomplete lines\n\n**What the fix should do:**\nThe core logic was correct - we need to change:\n- `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` \n- `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`\n\nThese escaped brackets `\\[` and `\\]` are LaTeX commands for display math mode delimiters, but for sequence notation we want literal square brackets.\n\n## Concrete Fix Plan\n\n1. **Find the exact method**: Look for `_print_SeqFormula` or similar sequence printing method in `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n\n2. **Make the change**: Replace the escaped brackets with regular brackets:\n ",
