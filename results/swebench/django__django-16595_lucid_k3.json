The new code was added BEFORE the existing checks, but the method structure requires proper ordering.\n\nMore critically, the patch returns `[operation]` (the newer operation), which is correct for reducing consecutive `AlterField` operations - we want to keep only the last one since it represents the final state. However, the placement matters because:\n\n1. The `reduce()` method should check conditions in a specific order\n2. The parent class's `reduce()` is called at the end via `super().reduce()`\n3.

The test is likely failing because when multiple `AlterField` operations are reduced, the `preserve_default` attribute needs to be properly handled.\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n1. `AlterField.__init__` accepts a `preserve_default` parameter (defaults to `True`)\n2. When reducing `AlterField` \u2192 `AlterField`, the patch returns `[operation]` (the newer operation)\n3. However, this doesn't account for the `preserve_default` attribute from the first operation\n\n**Key insights from the code:**\n\n1. The `AddField.reduce()` method shows the pattern: when reducing `AddField` + `AlterField`, it creates a new `AddField` with the field from the `AlterField` operation\n2.

However, the test failure (image build error aside) suggests the logic is incomplete. The patch doesn't properly handle the `preserve_default` attribute when reducing operations.\n\n**Key Issue:**\nWhen reducing `AlterField` \u2192 `AlterField`, we should:\n1. Return only the **later** operation (which has the final field state)\n2. BUT preserve the `preserve_default` from the **first** operation if it's `False`\n\nThe reason is that `preserve_default=False` is a special flag used during migration to temporarily set a default value for existing rows. If the first `AlterField` has `preserve_default=False`, this information should be retained even when reducing with subsequent `AlterField` operations.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct reduction logic should b",
