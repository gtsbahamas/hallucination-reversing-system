      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Check placed inside the loop**: The length check `if initial_len is not None and len(seq) != initial_len` is inside the `for` loop, which means it only checks when yielding elements. If the sequence is modified but no more elements are yielded, the check won't trigger.\n\n2. **Incorrect exception handling flow**: The `TypeError` exception handler at the end is meant to handle cases where `seq` doesn't support `__getitem__` (used by `enumerate`). However, the patch doesn't account for the fact that when a `TypeError` is caught, the variable `s` from the failed iteration is used, but at that point we've already partially iterated through `seq`.\n\n3. **Logic error in exception handler**: The exception handler has `for s in uniq(seq, result)` which would re-iterate the entire sequence from the beginning, not just the remaining elements. This would cause duplicate",
