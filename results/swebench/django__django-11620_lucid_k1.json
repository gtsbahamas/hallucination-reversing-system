      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply correctly. Looking at the error messages:\n\n1. **Patch application issues**: The patch had formatting problems - \"patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line\" and \"Hunk #2 FAILED\"\n2. **Wrong approach**: The patch tried to modify line numbers that don't match the actual file structure\n3. **Incomplete patch**: The first hunk only added the `Http404` import but didn't show where it's actually used\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch had two main issues:\n1. **Import was added correctly** but the second hunk (the actual fix) failed to apply\n2. **Line numbers were incorrect** - the patch assumed `technical_404_response` starts at line 476, but we need to find the actual location\n3. **Formatting issues** - the patch had whitespace/formatting problems causing it to fail mid-line\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\n- The test `test_technical_404_converter_raise_404` expects that when `Http404` is raised in a path converter's `to_python` method, it ",
