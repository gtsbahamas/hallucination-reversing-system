The issue states that users are getting deprecation warnings for ManagementForm even though they never use `{{ form }}` to render forms. The problem is that ManagementForm is **inheriting** the default template behavior from the `Form` class, which triggers the deprecation warning.\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nThe hint in the issue description shows the comment `# RemovedInDjango50Warning.` next to the template assignment, suggesting this is meant to **suppress** the warning, not trigger it. The management form only produces hidden inputs, so the template choice is irrelevant - it should use the new template to avoid the deprecation warning.\n\n**What the test expects:**\nThe test description states:",
