      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure and the previous patch, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n### What Was Wrong with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Circular dependency in `__getattr__`**: The patch tries to access `__version__` within `__getattr__` when computing `__version_info__`, but `__version__` itself is computed lazily via `__getattr__`. This creates a problematic dependency chain.\n\n2. **Missing caching**: The `__version_info__` is computed every time it's accessed, but it's not properly cached like `__version__` is.\n\n3. **Test infrastructure issue**: The actual test failure shows a Docker image build error, but the logic issue would manifest as either infinite recursion or incorrect behavior.\n\n### Key Insights from Test Requirements\n\nThe tests expect `_parse_to_version_info` to handle various version formats:\n- `3.5.0` \u2192 standard release\n- `3.5.0rc2` \u2192 release candidate  \n- `3.5.0.dev820+g6768ef8c4c` \u2192 dev release\n- `3.5.0.post820+g6768ef8c4c` \u2192 post release\n\nThe f",

The patch incorrectly sets `serial = 0` for post-releases, but it should extract the post-release number.\n\n## Key Issues\n\n1. **Post-release handling is wrong**: For `3.5.0.post820+g6768ef8c4c`, the code sets `serial = 0` instead of `serial = 820`\n2. **Missing post-release number extraction**: The `packaging.version.Version` object has a `.post` attribute that contains the post-release number\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe `_parse_to_version_info` function needs to be correct",

This is incorrect because:\n   - A post-release (e.g., `3.5.0.post820`) should still be treated as 'final' but the serial should represent the post number\n   - However, the logic conflicts with regular final releases\n\n2.
