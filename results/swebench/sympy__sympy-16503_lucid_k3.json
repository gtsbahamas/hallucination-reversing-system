This is incorrect because:\n\n1. The return value is `(d, h + 2*more, lines, baseline)` where the 4th element is the baseline\n2. The baseline should be relative to the bottom of the prettyForm (0-indexed from bottom)\n3. `h//2 + more` would place the baseline too high when `h` (the function height) is large\n4. The issue states that for simple expressions like `x`, the baseline should be **lower**, not higher\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the issue examples:\n- `Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3`: The `x` should be lower (currently too high)\n- `Sum(x**2, (x, 1, oo)) + 3`: Works correctly because `x**2` has height > 1\n\nThe problem is that when the function `f` has height 1 (like a simple `x`), the baseline calculation `more` places it too high.

Looking at the code structure:\n\n1. The function returns `(d, h + 2*more, lines, more)` where the last value is the baseline adjustment\n2. The baseline adjustment `more` is calculated based on the height of the summand\n3. When the summand has height 1 (like a simple `x`), the baseline is still being adjusted by `more`, causing misalignment\n\nFrom the hints in the issue:\n- `Sum(x**2, ...)` works because `x**2` has height > 1\n- `Sum(x, ...)` fails because `x` has height = 1\n- The suggested fix `more // 2` works for simple cases but breaks complex ones\n\n## The R",
