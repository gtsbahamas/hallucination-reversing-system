However, the test results show the evaluation failed due to a Docker image error, not test failures. This suggests the patch wasn't actually tested properly.\n\nBut examining the code more carefully, I can see a critical issue: **`check_scalar` is being called with the wrong signature**. Looking at the usage pattern:\n\n```python\ncheck_scalar(self.n_components, 'n_components', numbers.Integral, 1)\n```\n\nThe function appears to expect: `(value, name, type, min_val)`. However, when using abstract base classes like `numbers.Integral` and `numbers.Real`, we need to verify that `check_scalar` actually supports these types.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **The real issue**: The problem is that `check_scalar` likely uses `isinstance(",

However, **the patch failed to build the Docker image**, which means we cannot see the actual test results.\n\nLooking at the error:\n```\nError building image scikit-learn__scikit-learn-14092: 404 Client Error\n```\n\nThis is an infrastructure issue, not a code issue. However, we can still analyze what the patch was trying to do and whether it would work.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **The Core Problem**: The issue states that NCA fails in GridSearch because:\n   - `tol=1` (Python `int`) is not accepted when expecting `float`\n   - `n_components=np.int64(5)` is not accepted when expecting `int`\n\n2. **The Solution Approach**: Using `numbers.Integral` and `numbers.Real` from the `numbers` module is the **correct approach** because:\n   - `numbers.I",

However, the tests are still failing because there's a **Docker image build error**, not a test logic error. The actual fix is correct in principle.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **The core issue**: NCA's `check_scalar` calls were too strict, checking for exact types (`int`, `float`) instead of accepting numeric types that behave like integers/floats (e.g., `np.int64`, `np.float64`).\n\n2. **The solution approach is correct**: Using `numbers.Integral` and `numbers.Real` from the `numbers` module allows numpy integer and float types to pass validation, which is exactly what's needed for GridSearchCV compatibility.\n\n3. **The specific changes needed**:\n   - `n_components`: `int` \u2192 `numbers.Integral` (accepts `np",
