      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch attempted to avoid `copy.deepcopy()` by implementing a custom `_clone()` method. However, the implementation has a critical flaw: it doesn't properly handle the case where children are tuples (key-value pairs from kwargs).\n\nWhen you do `Q(x__in={}.keys())`, the children list contains a tuple like `('x__in', dict_keys([]))`. The `_clone()` method copies this tuple directly, but **tuples are immutable and contain a reference to the same `dict_keys` object**. This means the clone still references the non-pickleable object.\n\n**The real issue:**\nThe problem occurs in the `_combine()` method when it calls `obj.add(self, conn)` and `obj.add(other, conn)`. The `add()` method (inherited from `tree.Node`) uses `copy.deepcopy()` internally, which tries to pickle the children, including the `dict_keys` object.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\n",
