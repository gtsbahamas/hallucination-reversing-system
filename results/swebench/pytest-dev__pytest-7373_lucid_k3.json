While this removes the incorrect caching of *results*, it introduces unnecessary overhead by recompiling the same expression string multiple times.\n\n**Why the test failed:**\nThe test failure appears to be an infrastructure/Docker issue (\"No such image\"), not a logic error in the patch itself. However, the patch is still suboptimal.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Remove the global `evalcache_key` and `cached_eval` function** \u2713 (already done)\n2. **Inline the evaluation** \u2713 (already done)  \n3. **BUT: Cach",

However, **the test failed due to an infrastructure/Docker issue**, not because of the logic itself. The error shows:\n```\nError building image pytest-dev__pytest-7373: 404 Client Error ... No such image\n```\n\nThis is an environment problem, not a code problem.\n\n## Analysis of the Approach\n\nThe previous patch's approach was actually **overly complex**. It:\n1. Removed the `cached_eval` function \u2713\n2. Removed the `evalcache_key` \u2713  \n3. But then introduced a **new global cache** `_exprcode_cache` for compiled code objects\n\nThis defeats the purpose! The issue states we should \"simply remove the caching\" and \"inline `cached_eval` into `MarkEvaluator._istrue`\".\n\n## The Correct Fix Plan\n\n**Remove ALL caching completely:**\n\n1. **Delete** the `evalcache_key` variable\n2. **Delete** the ",
