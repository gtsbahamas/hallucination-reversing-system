      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format** - it had formatting issues with the diff structure. The patch was trying to modify the `_print_SeqFormula` method but had:\n\n1. Trailing whitespace issues\n2. Incomplete/malformed diff hunks\n3. The patch \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\"\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the issue description, the problem is clear:\n- Current output: `\\left\\[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\right\\]` \n- Expected output: `\\left[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\right]`\n\nThe brackets `[` and `]` are being **escaped** as `\\[` and `\\]` in the raw string literals. In LaTeX:\n- `\\left[` and `\\right]` are correct (creates scalable brackets)\n- `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` are wrong (escapes the bracket character itself)\n\nThe issue is in the `_print_SeqFormula` method around line 1956 in `sympy/printing/latex.py`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\nIn the `_print_SeqFormula` method, change:\n- `r\"\\left\\[\"` \u2192 `r\"\\left[\"`\n- `r\"\\right\\]\"` \u2192 `r\"\\right]",

Looking at the LaTeX syntax:\n\n1. `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` - These are **escaped square brackets** that render as literal `[` and `]` characters\n2. `\\left[` and `\\right]` - These are **delimiter commands** that expect a matching bracket\n\nThe issue is that `\\left` and `\\right` are LaTeX commands for **auto-sizing delimiters**, but they need proper bracket syntax. In LaTeX:\n- `\\left[` and `\\right]` ar",
