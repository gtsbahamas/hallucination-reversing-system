A model has both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields\n2. You try to delete only the `index_together` \n3. The `_delete_composed_index()` method finds **both** constraints (the unique constraint and the index) and raises a `ValueError` because it expects exactly 1 constraint\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to exclude meta constraints and indexes from the search:\n```python\nconstraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n    **constraint_kwargs\n)\n```\n\nHowever, this approach has a fundamental flaw: **it excludes ALL meta constraints and indexes**, but we actually need to find and delete the specific index we're looking for.

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect exclusion logic**: The patch tried to exclude unique constraints when looking for index constraints to delete, but this is backwards. When `constraint_kwargs.get('index')` is True, we're looking for an index to delete, not a unique constraint.\n\n2. **Wrong constraint type filtering**: The code calls `_constraint_names()` with `index=True` (via `constraint_kwargs`), which should only return index constraints. But then it tries to also exclude unique constraints, which creates a logical contradiction.\n\n3. **The real issue**: The problem is that `_constraint_names()` is finding BOTH the unique constraint (from `unique_together`) AND the index constraint (from `index_together`) when they're on the same columns, because the method doesn't properly filter by constraint type.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Context\n\n1.

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the patch failed to apply because of a malformed diff. The issue is in the first hunk - it's trying to modify line 1215, but the condition check is incorrect and the patch is malformed (ends in middle of line).\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n1. **Malformed diff**: The first hunk has syntax errors and doesn't properly modify the code\n2. **Wrong approach**: The patch tries to return early with `return []` when both `index` and `unique` are True, but this prevents finding ANY constraints, not just filtering out the wrong ones\n3. **Logic error**: The condition `if deferrable is not None or (index and unique):` doesn't make sense - it would skip constraint lookup entirely when we're looking for an index that's also unique\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue is in `_constraint_names()` method.
