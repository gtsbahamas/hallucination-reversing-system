      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch only converted the `data` Series to int when computing `vmin` and `vmax`, but this conversion was local and didn't persist\n2. The converted data wasn't used in the subsequent `axis.convert_units()` call\n3. Most critically, the `forward()` function is later called on the original boolean `vmin` and `vmax` values, which still causes the boolean subtraction error at line `b = forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)`\n\n**The root cause:**\nThe error occurs because:\n1. `vmin` and `vmax` are extracted as boolean values (True/False)\n2. These are passed to `axis.convert_units()` which may keep them as booleans\n3. Then `forward(vmin)` and `forward(vmax)` are called, returning boolean values\n4. The subtraction `forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` fails because numpy doesn't support boolean subtraction\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to convert boolean values to ",
