      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the error, I can see the issue:\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed during the Docker image build phase, which suggests there's a syntax or import error in the code. Looking at the patch more carefully:\n\n**Critical Issue**: The patch added imports at the wrong location in the file. It added:\n```python\nimport time\nimport platform\nfrom datetime import datetime\n```\n\nBut `import time` was **already present** in the file at line 17. The patch tried to add it again, which would cause issues. Additionally, the new imports (`platform` and `datetime`) were added in the middle of the existing import block without proper context.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Import Statement Fix**:\n   - Don't re-import `time` (it's already there)\n   - Add `import platform` after the existing `import time` line\n   - Add `from datetime import datetime` after `import platform`\n   - Ensure proper placement in the import section (after standard library imports, before third-party im",
