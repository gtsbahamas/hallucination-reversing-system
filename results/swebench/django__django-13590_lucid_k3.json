However, I can analyze the patch based on the issue description and code structure.\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the issue by changing:\n```python\nvalue = type_(values)\n```\nto:\n```python\nvalue = type_(*values)\n```\n\nThis change is **correct in principle** but there's a critical problem: `values` is a **generator expression**, not a list or tuple. You cannot use the `*` unpacking operator directly on a generator in a function call in the way shown.\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen you write `type_(*values)` where `values` is a generator, Python will try to unpack the generator, but the syntax is actually valid. However, looking more carefully at the code context:\n\n```python\nvalues = (\n    self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n    for sub_value in value\n)\n# Convert the gener",

      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and what the correct fix should be.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is in the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. When a named tuple is used as an argument to `__range`, the code tries to:\n\n1. Iterate through the tuple elements to resolve lookups\n2. Reconstruct the tuple with resolved elements\n3. Preserve the original type (the named tuple class)\n\nThe problem occurs at step 3. The code does:\n```python\nvalues = (\n    self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n    for sub_value in value\n)\n# Convert the generator to the appropriate container type.\nvalue = type_(values)  # WRONG!\n```\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted:\n```python\nvalue = type_(*values)\n```\n\nThis unpacks the generator `values` as arguments to the constructor. However, this is **still incorrect** because:\n\n1. `values` is a **generator**, not a tuple/list\n",

For regular tuples: `tuple([1, 2])` works fine\n2. For named tuples: `NamedTuple([1, 2])` fails because named tuples expect positional arguments, not an iterable\n3. The fix needs to unpack the iterable: `NamedTuple(*[1, 2])` or `NamedTuple(1, 2)`\n\n**But there's another problem:** The original code used a generator expression `(... for ...)`, and the patch changed it to a list `[...]`.
