The patch removed the `Atom` import that was being used in the original code\n2. The logic change from `isinstance(node, Atom)` to `not node.args` is correct conceptually, but there's a critical issue\n3. The test failed with a Docker image error, but more importantly, the patch has a logical flaw\n\n**The Core Problem:**\nThe original code had:\n```python\nfrom .atom import Atom\n```\n\nBut the patch removed this import while changing the logic. However, looking more carefully at the code structure, the real issue is that **the patch didn't handle the case where `types` is provided correctly**.\n\nWhen `types` is specified, the code should still check `isinstance(node, types)` but when NO types are specified, it should return nodes with `not node.args` instead of `isinstance(node, Atom)`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Keep the Atom import** (or verify it's not needed",

The patch removed the `nodes = _preorder_traversal(self)` line but this was just dead code - not the actual issue\n2. The core change `if not node.args:` instead of `if isinstance(node, Atom)` is correct in principle\n3. However, the test failure suggests there's a Docker/infrastructure issue, not a logic issue with the patch itself\n\n**The actual problem:**\nThe test output shows a Docker image error, not a test failure from the code change. This means we can't see the real test results. However, based on the issue description and hints, we know:\n\n1. Some objects like `BaseScalar` and `BaseVector` are subclasses of `Atom` but have `.args`\n2. The old behavior would include these in `atoms()` results\n3. The new behavior (checking `not node.args`) would exclude them\n4. This is the **correct** behavior according to the issue - atoms should be leaf node",

However, I can analyze the patch itself to identify issues:\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Removed `nodes = _preorder_traversal(self)` line**: This was unnecessary and created a duplicate traversal in the `if types:` branch.\n\n2. **Test modification in `test_field_functions.py`**: The patch tried to exclude `BaseVector` and `BaseScalar` from atoms, but this is incorrect. The issue states that objects with **no args** should be returned. If `BaseVector` and `BaseScalar` have args, they shouldn't be in atoms() - but the test needs to verify what the actual behavior should be, not just assert they're excluded.\n\n3. **Test in `test_basic.py`**: Changed `x = Symbol('x')` to `x = Symbol('x', real=True)` in `test_equality()` - this is unrelated to the atoms() fix and could cause issues.\n\n4. **New test `test_atoms()`**: Good addition, but needs",
