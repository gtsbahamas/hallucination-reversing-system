      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Import location**: The patch imports `defaultdict` inside the function, which is fine, but more critically it uses `Mul` without importing it from `sympy.core.mul`.\n\n2. **Type mismatch**: The patch combines factors using `Mul(*factor_list)`, but the factors in the list are already SymPy expressions (not Poly objects). When combining them with `Mul`, it creates a raw expression, not maintaining consistency with the input format.\n\n3. **Loss of structure**: The original `_generic_factor_list` returns factors as expressions. When we use `Mul(*factor_list)` to combine them, we get a multiplied expression, but we lose the factored form that should be maintained.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure shows a Docker image build error, but the real issue is that the patch doesn't properly handle the combination of factors.

      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed during the Docker image build phase, so we don't have actual test results. However, I can analyze the conceptual issues with the patch:\n\n### Problems with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Wrong approach**: The patch tries to combine factors by multiplying them together using `Mul(*factor_list)`, but this is incorrect. When we have `(x-2, 3)` and `(x-3, 3)`, we should get `(x**2 - 5*x + 6, 3)`, not `((x-2)*(x-3), 3)`. The multiplication needs to happen at the polynomial level, not the expression level.\n\n2. **Import issue**: The patch imports `expand` from sympy at the function level, which is inefficient and may cause circular import issues.\n\n3. **Type mismatch**: The factors returned by `_generic_factor_list` are expressions, not `Poly` objects. Simply multiplying them and expanding won't properly combine them as polynomials.\n\n4. **Missing the root cause**: The issue states that `Poly(...).sqf_list()` works correctly, but the st",
