      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply because of a formatting issue - the patch file ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. This is a technical issue with how the patch was generated, not a logical problem with the fix itself.\n\nLooking at the patch content:\n```diff\ndef id_for_label(self, id_):\n-        return '%s_0' % id_ if id_ else ''\n+        return ''\n```\n\nThis is actually the **correct fix** based on the issue requirements. The problem is purely in the patch format.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe patch file was malformed - it \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\" according to the error message. This suggests the patch diff wasn't properly terminated or had encoding issues.\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nThe exact same logical change needs to be applied, but with a properly formatted patch:\n\n1. **Location**: `django/forms/widgets.py`, in the `MultiWidget` class's `id_for_label` method (around line 857-858)\n\n2. **Change**: Replace the current implementation that returns `'%s_0' %",
