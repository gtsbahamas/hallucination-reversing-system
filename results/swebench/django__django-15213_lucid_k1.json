      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format**. The diff had incorrect structure - specifically, the logic flow was broken and the patch didn't properly handle the conditional branches.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Malformed diff syntax**: The patch had improper indentation and structure that couldn't be applied\n2. **Logic error**: The original code had `elif not sql_string:` which checked if sql_string was empty, but the condition `self.negated` was checked first. The patch tried to restructure this but created invalid syntax\n3. **Missing the root cause**: The issue is that when `self.negated` is True AND `sql_string` is empty (which happens with `~Q(pk__in=[])`), the code path doesn't generate any SQL, resulting in an empty string being returned\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nLooking at the original code in `django/db/models/sql/where.py`:\n\n```python\nif self.negated:\n    sql_string = 'NOT (%s)' % sql_string  # If sql_string is empty, this b",
