      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and what the actual problem is.\n\n## Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe problem is that `Intersection({1},{1},{x})` returns `EmptySet()` when it should either:\n1. Return `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))`, or\n2. Remain unevaluated\n\nThe issue states that duplicates should be removed at the outset, and the routine should give the same answer whether duplicates are present or not.\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to remove duplicates using a simple `set()` and `ordered()` approach, but this has several problems:\n\n1. **Set comparison issue**: Using `arg not in seen` with a regular Python `set()` doesn't work correctly for SymPy objects because it relies on hash equality, which may not match SymPy's equality semantics.\n\n2. **Incomplete implementation**: The patch only added duplicate removal but didn't ensure it was called before the existing logic in `__new__`.

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch only removed duplicates but didn't handle the core issue: when duplicates exist, the intersection logic produces incorrect results\n2. The patch returned a single set when only one unique set remained, but this bypasses the normal `Intersection` evaluation logic that handles symbolic sets\n3. Most critically, it didn't address the root cause: the `reduce` method in `Intersection` processes sets sequentially, and when duplicates exist, it can produce wrong results with symbolic sets\n\n## Key Insights from the Issue\n\nThe problem is demonstrated by:\n```python\nIntersection({1},{1},{x})  # Returns EmptySet() - WRONG\nIntersection({1},{x})      # Returns {1} - CORRECT\n```\n\nThe issue states the answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated. This tells us:\n- When `x=1`, both `{1}` and `{x}` are the same set, s",

When comparing `{1}` with `{x}`, the equality check may not behave as expected, especially when `x` is a symbol.\n\n2. **Missing sympification**: The args aren't being sympified before duplicate removal, which could lead to inconsistent comparisons.\n\n3. **Not calling parent's `__new__`**: The patch directly calls `Basic.__new__(cls, *args)` without going through the proper `LatticeOp` initialization that handles evaluation logic.\n\n4. **Premature duplicate removal**: Removing duplicates before the standard evaluation logic runs means the intersection logic never gets a chance to properly handle the case where sets might be symbolically equal.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Context\n\nThe issue states:\n- `Intersection({1},{1},{x})` return",
