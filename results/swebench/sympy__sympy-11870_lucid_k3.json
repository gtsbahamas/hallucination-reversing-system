      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the key problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect `sin._eval_rewrite_as_sinc`**: The implementation `return self.func(arg) / arg` is backwards - it tries to convert `sin(x)` to `sin(x)/x`, which is the definition of `sinc(x)`, not a rewrite of `sin` in terms of `sinc`. It should be `return arg * sinc(arg)` since `sin(x) = x * sinc(x)`.\n\n2. **Missing Piecewise in `sinc._eval_rewrite_as_exp`**: The exponential form needs to handle the `x=0` case properly with Piecewise, just like the `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` method does.\n\n3. **Incomplete `sinc` rewrites**: The patch added `_eval_rewrite_as_exp` but didn't add other useful rewrites like `_eval_rewrite_as_cos` that were attempted.\n\n4. **Unnecessary `exp._eval_rewrite_as_sinc`**: This was added but returned `None` in all cases, making it useless. The real issue is that `trigsimp` needs to recognize exponential patterns and convert them to t",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the error, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Wrong import location**: The patch imports `Piecewise` from `sympy.functions.special.hyper`, but `Piecewise` is actually in `sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise`.\n\n2. **Circular dependency in sin's rewrite**: Adding `_eval_rewrite_as_sinc` to the `sin` class creates a problematic relationship since `sinc` is defined later in the same file and already has a rewrite to `sin`.\n\n3. **Missing import**: The patch adds `from sympy.core.relational import Ne` but this is used in the existing `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` method for `sinc`, not in the new code.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe core issue is that the user wants `trigsimp` to recognize exponential expressions as trig functions. The hint shows that `f.rewrite(sin).simplify()` works, but the user also wants `sinc` support.\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. The `sinc` class already exists and has `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` \n2. We need to add `_eval_rewr",
