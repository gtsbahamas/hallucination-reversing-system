      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, it seems there was an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found), not a code issue. However, let me analyze the previous patch attempt and provide a better fix plan.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect placement**: The dummification check was placed too early, before `names` list was populated\n2. **Logic error**: The check tried to iterate over `flatten(args)` and check `arg.name`, but at that point we haven't extracted names yet\n3. **Incomplete check**: It only checked if dummification was needed but didn't actually handle the case properly\n\n**Key insights from the code:**\n\n1. The `names` list is populated by iterating through `args` and extracting names\n2. The `_is_safe_ident()` function checks if a name is a valid Python identifier\n3. The dummification logic exists later in the code (around line 769+) but it's checking `funcname`, not the argument names\n4. When `dummify=True` is set, the code should replace invalid iden",
