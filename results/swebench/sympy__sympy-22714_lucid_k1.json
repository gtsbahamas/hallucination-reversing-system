      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch changed:\n```python\nif any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords):\n```\nto:\n```python\nif any(a.is_number and im(a).is_nonzero for a in coords):\n```\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe patch tried to fix the issue by checking if `im(a).is_nonzero` instead of just `im(a)`. However, this doesn't solve the root problem. When `evaluate=False`, the expression `im(Integer(1))` or `im(Integer(2))` doesn't evaluate to `0` - it remains as the unevaluated expression `im(Integer(1))`. When you check `im(Integer(1)).is_nonzero`, it returns `None` (unknown) rather than `False`, because the expression hasn't been evaluated yet.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n1. When `evaluate=False` is set globally, `im(a)` returns an unevaluated `im()` function call\n2. The truthiness check `if any(a.is_number and im(a) ...)` evaluates `im(a)` in a boolean context\n3. An unevaluated `im(",
