However, there's a fundamental mismatch:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When `_iter(fitted=True, replace_strings=True)` is called, it returns ALL fitted transformers from `transformers_`, including those with 0 features\n2. **The Mismatch**: The `Xs` list passed to `_hstack` only contains actual output arrays from transformers that produced output\n3. **The Logic Error**: The patch tried to filter based on checking `X.shape`, but `X` here is the output array from `_iter`, not from the actual transformation\n\nThe key insight is that `_iter(fitted=True)` yields tuples of `(name, transformer, columns)`, not `(name, transformer, output_array)`. The third element is the column specification, not the transformed output.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the code flow:\n- ",

However, `self._iter()` only yields transformers that were **fitted**, while `Xs` contains outputs from **all** transformers that produced output during transform.\n\n2. **The core issue**: When a transformer has 0 features, it's not fitted (skipped during fit), so it doesn't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)`. But the corresponding empty output still exists in `Xs`. This causes the iterator to get out of sync - we're trying to match fitted transformers with a list that includes outputs from unfitted transformers.\n\n3. **The error**: The test likely fails because the iterator consumption doesn't align properly, leading to either:\n   - Trying to call `next()` too many times (StopIte",
