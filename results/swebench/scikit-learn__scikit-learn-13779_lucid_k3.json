      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe patch only fixed the `has_fit_parameter` check to skip `None` estimators, but this is insufficient. The actual error occurs later when the code tries to fit the estimators.\n\n**The root cause:**\nWhen `sample_weight` is passed and an estimator is set to `None`, the code in `_parallel_fit_estimator` still tries to call `.fit()` on `None` estimators. The filtering `if clf is not None` happens in the Parallel loop comprehension, but the `sample_weight` validation happens BEFORE this filtering.\n\n**Key insight from the code flow:**\n1. The validation loop checks ALL estimators (including `None` ones)\n2. The previous patch fixed the validation to skip `None` estimators \u2713\n3. BUT the actual fitting happens in `Parallel(...)` which already filters `None` estimators \u2713\n4. The issue is that the test is still failing, which suggests the Docker build failed, ",

However, I can analyze the previous patch and the issue to understand what's needed.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch added a check `step is not None` before calling `has_fit_parameter(step, 'sample_weight')`. This is correct and necessary to prevent the AttributeError when checking if a None estimator supports sample weights.\n\nHowever, this patch alone is **incomplete**. Let me trace through the code flow:\n\n1. The check at line 88-91 validates that all non-None estimators support sample_weight\n2. Then at line 101-104, estimators are fitted in parallel, filtering out None estimators: `for clf in clfs if clf is not None`\n3. But at line 106-108, the code tries to map fitted estimators back to original estimators\n\n**The problem**: After filtering out None estimators during parallel fitting, the `estimators_` list will be shorter than the original",

The patch correctly added `step is not None` check for sample_weight validation\n2. However, the `named_estimators_` building logic is **flawed**:\n   - It uses `iter(self.estimators_)` and `next(est_iter)` \n   - It only calls `next()` when `est is not None`\n   - But `self.estimators_` only contains **non-None** estimators (filtered during parallel fit)\n   - This creates a mismatch: if we skip calling `next()` for None estimators, we'll assign the wrong fitted estimator to the wrong name\n\n**Example of the bug:**\n```python\nself.estimators = [('lr', LogisticRegression()), ('rf', None), ('dt', DecisionTree())]\n# After parallel fit:\nself.estimators_ = [fitted_lr, fitted_dt]  # Only 2 items, no None\n\n# With buggy logic:\n# - name='lr', est=LogisticR",
