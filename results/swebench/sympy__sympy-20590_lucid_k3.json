The error message shows:\n```\nError building image sympy__sympy-20590: 404 Client Error ... No such image\n```\n\nThis is a test environment problem, not a code problem.\n\n**However, there's a critical issue to address:**\n\nLooking at the file path and the issue description, the problem is that `Printable` was renamed to `DefaultPrinting` in the actual codebase (as mentioned in the issue hints), but the patch is trying to modify a class called `Printable`. \n\nThe issue states:\n> \"It seems that Basic now inherits `DefaultPrinting` which I guess doesn't have slots.\"\n\nBut the source file shows a class named `Printable`, not `DefaultPrinting`.
