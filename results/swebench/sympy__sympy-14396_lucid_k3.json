      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Incomplete regex pattern**: The `_re_polynomial` regex was updated to include `R|RR|C|CC`, but this creates ambiguity with the `_re_polynomial_prec` pattern. The order of matching matters.\n\n2. **Missing return statement**: Line 481 has `retu` instead of `return` (truncated in the source), but more critically, the logic flow is problematic.\n\n3. **Regex matching order**: The `_re_polynomial_prec` pattern should be checked BEFORE the general `_re_polynomial` pattern, otherwise `RR[y,z]` might match the wrong pattern.\n\n4. **Test infrastructure issue**: The actual test failure shows a Docker image build error, not a code logic error. However, we need to ensure the code logic is correct.\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFrom the issue description:\n- `Poly(1.2*x*y*z, x)` automatically infers `domain='RR[y,z]'` \u2713\n- `Poly(1.2*x*y*z, x, domain='RR[y,z]')` should work but throws `OptionError",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch added support for `RR[y,z]` and `CC[y,z]` patterns, but there's a critical **order issue** in the regex matching\n2. The `_re_polynomial_prec` pattern (e.g., `RR_53[y,z]`) is checked AFTER `_re_polynomial` \n3. However, `_re_polynomial` now matches `RR[y,z]` due to the expanded pattern `(Z|ZZ|Q|QQ|R|RR|C|CC)\\[(.+)\\]$`\n4. When `_re_polynomial` matches `RR[y,z]`, it extracts `ground='RR'` and `gens='y,z'`, but then tries to handle it in the if-elif chain that only properly handles `Z/ZZ` and `Q/QQ` cases\n5. The new `elif ground in ['R', 'RR']:` branch tries to call `sympy.polys.domains.RR.poly_ring(*gens)`, but **`RR` is already a domain object (RealField), not a base domain class** - it doesn't have a `poly_ring` method in the same way `ZZ` and `QQ` do\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\n- `sympy.polys.domains.RR` is an instance of `RealField` wi",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch failed to build the Docker image, so we can't see actual test failures\n2. However, examining the code logic reveals a critical flaw: the regex patterns are checked in the wrong order\n3. The `_re_polynomial_prec` pattern (for `RR_53[y,z]`) is checked AFTER the general `_re_polynomial` pattern\n4. Since `_re_polynomial` was expanded to match `R|RR|C|CC`, it will match `RR[y,z]` BEFORE the more specific `_re_polynomial_prec` can match `RR_53[y,z]`\n5. This means precision-based polynomial rings will never be matched correctly\n\n**Example of the problem:**\n- Input: `\"RR_53[y,z]\"`\n- The expanded `_re_polynomial` regex `^(Z|ZZ|Q|QQ|R|RR|C|CC)\\[(.+)\\]$` won't match (good)\n- But input `\"RR[y,z]\"` will match the expanded `_re_polynomial` before reaching `_re_polynomial_prec`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Reorder the regex checks**: Check `_re_polynomial_prec` BE",
