When you then call `defer(\"name\")`, it should recognize that you're deferring the only field you said to load, effectively resetting to \"load only pk\".\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch had the right idea but the logic was flawed:\n\n```python\nif existing.difference(field_names):\n    # If there are still fields in the only() set after removing\n    # the defer() fields, stay in only() mode.\n    self.deferred_loa",
