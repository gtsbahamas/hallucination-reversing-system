      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I can see the problem clearly:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the issue by modifying `get_field()` in `PolynomialRing` to recursively convert the domain to its field. However, this approach has a critical flaw:\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch checks `if self.domain.has_assoc_Ring and self.domain.has_assoc_Field` but this condition is too broad\n2. It tries to clone the ring with `self.domain.get_field()` as the new domain, but this creates an infinite recursion or incorrect domain conversion\n3. The logic doesn't properly handle the case where `ZZ[y]` needs to become `QQ[y]` (not `QQ(y)`)\n\n## Root Cause\n\nFrom the issue discussion, the core problem is:\n- When we have `(x+y)/(2*x-y)` and call `apart(expr, x)`, the domain is detected as `ZZ[y]` (integers with polynomial coefficients in y)\n- During polynomial division, fractional coefficients like `1/2` and `3/2` appear\n- When `ZZ[y]` is converted to its field `ZZ(y)`, these f",
