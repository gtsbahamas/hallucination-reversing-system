      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and the test infrastructure problem.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n### What the Issue Shows\nThe issue demonstrates that `trigsimp()` fails to simplify expressions like:\n```python\nsin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25)\n```\nwhich should simplify to `cos(1/50)` using the identity: `cos(a-b) = cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b)`\n\n### Root Cause (from hints)\nThe hint clearly identifies that:\n1. `TR10i` performs the transformation: `sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y) -> cos(x-y)`\n2. `TRmorrie` transforms: `cos(x)*cos(2*x)*...*cos(2**(k-1)*x) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))`\n3. When `TRmorrie` runs BEFORE `TR10i`, it transforms the expression into a form that `TR10i` can no longer recognize\n4. Example: `sin(x)*sin(2*x) + cos(x)*cos(2*x)` becomes `sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + sin(2/25)/(4*sin(1/50))` after TRmorrie, which TR10i cannot simplify\n\n### What Was Wrong with the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to swap `TRmorrie",
