The patch raises `NotImplementedError` when encountering symbolic comparisons, but this exception is not being caught properly by the parent class\n2. The approach of raising an exception doesn't integrate well with SymPy's expression system - it should return an unevaluated expression instead\n3. The logic doesn't handle the case where we need to return a `Piecewise` or conditional expression for symbolic indices\n\n**Key insights from test output:**\n- All three failing tests involve symbolic indexing (`test_block_index_symbolic`, `test_block_index_symbolic_nonzero`, `test_block_index_large`)\n- The tests expect the indexing to remain unevaluated when the block cannot be determined symbolically\n- Other tests pass, meaning the basic block indexing logic for concrete indices still works\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nInstead of raising `NotImplementedError`, the `_entry` method shou",

When indices are symbolic (like `i` where `i` could be 0, 1, 2, ... n), we cannot determine which block contains the element\n2.
