      "remediation": "Looking at the test results, there's a Docker image build error, but more importantly, I can see the issue with the previous patch - it has a syntax error with misplaced parentheses.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch had a syntax error - there's a stray closing parenthesis `)` after the `rel_to` assignment that breaks the code\n2. The logic for counting related tables happens too early - it counts based on the raw database table names, but then tries to match against the transformed model names\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. Line 185 in the patch has: `rel_to = ... )` with an extra closing paren\n2. The `related_table_counts` is built using `table2model(ref_db_table)` but this happens before we know if it's a self-reference\n3. The counting logic doesn't account for the fact that `rel_to` can be the string `\"self\"` for self-referential relationships\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Remove the syntax error** - eliminate the stray closing parenthesis after `rel_to` assignment\n\n2. **Fi",

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, there's a Docker image build error, but let me analyze the previous patch to identify the logical issues:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### Problems Identified:\n\n1. **Wrong `related_name` format**: The patch uses `\"%s_set\" % att_name` which would generate names like `field1_set`, `field2_set`. However, Django's default reverse accessor already uses the pattern `<model_name>_set`. The issue is about **clashing reverse accessors**, so we need unique `related_name` values that won't clash.\n\n2. **Incorrect placement**: The `related_name` is added to `extra_params` but the logic for determining `rel_to` happens AFTER we check if it needs a related_name. The code structure has:\n   - First: Check if `rel_to in needs_related_name`\n   - Then: Determine `rel_to` value\n   \n   This is backwards - we're checking before `rel_to` is defined in the current iteration.\n\n3. **Self-referential relations**: When `ref_db_table == table_name`, `rel_to` becomes `\"self\"`, but the",
