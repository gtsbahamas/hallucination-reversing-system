      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the issues:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Problems\n\n### 1. **Oracle Implementation Issue**\nThe Oracle patch directly interpolates the JSON path into the SQL string:\n```python\nsql = \"NOT JSON_EXISTS(%s, '%s')\" % (lhs, lhs_json_path)\n```\n\nThis is problematic because:\n- It's doing string formatting with `%` twice - once with `(lhs, lhs_json_path)` and the result still contains `%s` placeholders\n- The comment says \"Add paths directly into SQL because path expressions cannot be passed as bind variables\" but then returns `lhs_params` which still expects bind variables\n- This creates a mismatch between the SQL template and the parameters\n\n### 2. **SQLite Implementation Issue**\nThe SQLite patch looks mostly correct in structure, but there's a subtle issue with how it's checking for NULL:\n```python\n'JSON_TYPE(%s, %%s) IS NULL' % lhs\n```\n\nThis checks if the JSON_TYPE returns NULL, which happens when the key doesn't exist.

For Oracle: Using `NOT JSON_EXISTS()` to check if a key doesn't exist\n2. For SQLite: Using `JSON_TYPE(...) IS NULL` to check if a key doesn't exist\n\nHowever, **the test failed to run due to a Docker image issue**, not because of the logic itself. The error shows:\n```\nError building image django__django-13757: 404 Client Error ... No such image\n```\n\nThis is an infrastructure problem, not a code problem.\n\n## What the Patch Does (Correctly)\n\nThe patch correctly addresses the core issue:\n\n**Problem**: When `key__isnull=True`, the default `IsNull` lookup behavior would match both:\n- Objects where the key doesn't exist\n- Objects where the key exists with JSON `null` value\n\n**Solution**: The patch overrides the behavior for SQLite and Oracle to use database-specific JSON functions that distinguish between \"key doesn't exist\" vs \"ke",

Looking at the `KeyTransform` class, `preprocess_lhs` takes `compiler` and `connection` as arguments and returns `(lhs, params, key_transforms)`.\n\n## The Fix Plan\n\nThe correct implementation should:\n\n1. **For SQLite (`as_sqlite` method when `self.rhs=Tru",
