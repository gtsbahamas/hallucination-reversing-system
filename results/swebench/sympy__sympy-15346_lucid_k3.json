      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the previous patch attempt, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch simply swapped the order of `TRmorrie` and `TR10i` in the transformation sequence. However, this appears to have caused a Docker image build failure, which suggests there may be a deeper issue with how the test environment is set up rather than the patch itself being logically incorrect.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **The Core Problem**: `TRmorrie` transforms expressions like `cos(x)*cos(2*x)` into forms that `TR10i` can no longer recognize. For example:\n   - Input: `sin(x)*sin(2*x) + cos(x)*cos(2*x)`\n   - After TRmorrie: `sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + sin(2/25)/(4*sin(1/50))`\n   - This prevents `TR10i` from applying the identity `sin(a)*sin(b) + cos(a)*cos(b) = cos(a-b)`\n\n2. **The Hint's Suggestion**: The issue description explicitly states that swapping `TRmorrie` and `TR10i` should fix the problem, which makes logical sense.\n\n3. **Why Some Cases W",
