      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the issue, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incomplete Unicode range coverage**: The patch only added Greek character ranges (`\\u0370-\\u03FF\\u1F00-\\u1FFF`) to specific patterns, but Greek characters need broader support across the entire parser.\n\n2. **Inconsistent application**: The Unicode ranges were added to some regex patterns but not all necessary locations. Specifically:\n   - Added to `FM_PATTERN` (function name pattern)\n   - Added to `ARGS_PATTERN_TEMPLATE` \n   - Added to `NAME` and `SYMBOL` patterns\n   - Added to `_regex_names` in `_parse_old`\n   \n   But the issue is that Greek characters like `\u03bb` are **lowercase** and should be treated as valid variable names, not just in specific contexts.\n\n3. **Wrong character class in NAME pattern**: The `NAME` pattern is for \"lower-case letters\" but the Unicode range includes both upper and lowercase Greek letters. The pattern should allow lowercase Gre",
