While this seems logical, **the test failed due to a Docker image build error**, not because of the logic itself. However, there's still a conceptual issue with the approach.\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nThe issue is that the patch was incomplete. Looking at the code structure:\n\n1. **`Derivative` is defined in `sympy/core/function.py`** but the patch location shows it was trying to patch around line 1254\n2. The `Derivative` class likely doesn't have a `kind` property defined, causing it to fall back to `UndefinedKind`\n3. Simply returning `self.expr.kind` is correct for derivatives since the derivative of a matrix is still a matrix, and the derivative of a number is still a number\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFrom the issue description:\n- `Integral(A, x).kind` correctly returns `Matrix",
