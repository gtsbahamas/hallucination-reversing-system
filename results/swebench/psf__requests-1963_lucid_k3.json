On the next iteration, `prepared_request = req.copy()` copies the OLD request (from before the update)\n\nThis creates an off-by-one error where the method changes are always one iteration behind.\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nThe issue states that `resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the **original** request:\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()\n```\n\nThis happens at the **beginning** of the while loop, so any modifications made to `prepared_request` during one iteration are lost because the next iteration starts fresh from `req`.\n\n## The Fix Plan\n\nThe update to `req` must happen **before** the next iteration begins, which means it should be ",

However, this happens **after** the request has already been sent and we're about to loop back. The critical issue is that at the start of the next iteration, the code does:\n\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()\n```\n\nThis means we're copying from `req`, but the problem is more subtle - we need to ensure that when we copy, we're copying the **current state** (with the modified method from the previous redirect), not the original request.\n\n**The actual bug:**\nThe line `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the beginning of each iteration copies from `req`, which initially points to the original request. Even though the previous patch updates `req = prepared_request` at the end, the issue is that `req.co",
