However, I can analyze the previous patch based on the code structure and the issue description.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **`_print_Derivative` implementation is incorrect**: The method uses `self.stringify(expr.args, \", \")` which would print the raw arguments of the Derivative. For `Derivative(f(t), t)`, `expr.args` is `(f(t), t)`, so this would produce `D[f(t), t]` instead of the correct Mathematica syntax `D[f[t], t]`.\n\n2. **`_print_Float` is too simplistic**: Simply replacing 'e' with '*^' will break cases where 'e' appears in other contexts (though this is less likely in float representations). More importantly, it doesn't handle edge cases like when there's no exponent.\n\n### Key Insights\n\nFrom the Mathematica syntax:\n- Derivatives should be: `D[function, variable1, variable2, ...]`\n- The function part needs proper formatting with square brackets\n- For higher-",
