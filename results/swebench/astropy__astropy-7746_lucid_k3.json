The empty arrays are being passed down to WCSLIB before our Python-level checks can intercept them.\n\n3. **Incomplete coverage**: The patch only added checks in two locations within `_array_converter`, but the method has multiple code paths depending on how arguments are passed (single array vs. multiple arrays).\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failed to even run due to a Docker image issue, but based on the code structure and error traceback, the problem is clear:\n\n-",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and the test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Duplicate code**: The patch checks `args[0].shape[-1] != self.naxis` twice in a row, which is redundant and suggests a copy-paste error.\n\n2. **Wrong placement**: The empty array handling is placed too early in the logic flow, before proper validation of the input structure.\n\n3. **Incomplete handling**: The patch only handles two specific cases:\n   - When a 2D array is passed (the `len(args) == 2` branch)\n   - When multiple 1D arrays are passed (the `else` branch after checking for 2 args)\n   \n   But it doesn't handle the case where the function receives empty lists/arrays that need to be converted to numpy arrays first.\n\n4. **Missing early conversion**: The code doesn't convert empty lists to numpy arrays before checking their size, which could cause issues with the `np.asarray(arg).size == 0` check.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test `test_zero_size_in",

The patch only handled the `_return_list_of_arrays` path, but empty arrays can also go through the `_return_single_array` path\n2. The empty array check was placed too late - after creating `output = np.empty((len(axes[0]), self.naxis))`, which still works but is inefficient\n3. More critically, the patch didn't handle the case where the input goes directly to the underlying C function (`self.wcs.p2s(xy, o)`) which is what's causing the `InconsistentAxisTypesError`\n\n**Key insight from the error:**\nThe error `\"ncoord and/or nelem inconsistent with the wcsprm\"` comes from wcslib's C code when it receives an empty array. The issue is that when `xy` is empty (shape `(0, naxis)`), wcslib doesn't handle it properly.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Intercept empty arrays before they reach wcslib**: Check if the input is empty at the beginning of `_arra",
