Without `_state.db` set, this lookup goes to the default database instead of the specified `using` database.\n\n## What Went Wrong with the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix this by setting `permission._state.db = using` before assigning the `content_type`. However, **the test failed due to an infrastructure error** (Docker image not found), not because the logic was wrong. The patch itself appears correct.\n\nLooking at the code flow:\n1. When `permission.content_type = ct` is executed\n2. Django's FK descriptor checks if the relation is allowed via the router\n3.

      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and why the test failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is that when `migrate` is called with a specific database parameter (e.g., `--database=other`), the `create_permissions` function creates `Permission` objects with a foreign key to `ContentType`. When setting `permission.content_type = ct`, Django's FK descriptor tries to validate the relationship, which triggers a database router call to check if the relation is allowed. However, at this point, the `Permission` instance doesn't have `_state.db` set, so it defaults to the default database, causing the router to be called with the wrong database context.\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to set `_state.db` on the `Permission` instance **before** setting the `content_type` FK. However, the test failure suggests there might be an issue with the execution or the test environment itself (the error shows a Dock",

However, I can analyze the patch and provide insights.\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch is **correct in principle** but may have a subtle issue depending on when the `content_type` FK assignment triggers database access.\n\n### What the patch does:\n1. Converts list comprehension to explicit loop\n2. Sets `permission._state.db = using` **before** assigning `content_type`\n3. This ensures the FK assignment uses the correct database context\n\n### Potential Issue:\n\nThe problem is that when you assign `permission.content_type = ct`, Django's FK descriptor may immediately try to validate the relationship through the database router. The router calls `db_for_read()` to determine which database to use, and if `_state.db` isn't set yet, it defaults to the wrong database.\n\nHowever, the patch **does** set `_state.db` before the FK assignment, so this sh",
