      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, it appears to be an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found) rather than a code issue. However, let me analyze what the previous patch was trying to do and identify potential problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to add a `_print_Identity` method to `NumPyPrinter` to handle Identity matrices. The approach was:\n\n1. Check if the shape is an integer\n2. If yes, print `numpy.eye(n)`\n3. If no, raise `NotImplementedError`\n\n## Problems with Previous Patch\n\n1. **Missing import check**: The code doesn't verify that `expr` is actually an `Identity` instance before accessing its properties\n2. **Incomplete handling**: The patch only added `_print_Identity` but didn't consider that Identity might be printed through other paths (like `_print_MatrixBase`)\n3. **Shape access**: Identity matrices have a `.shape` attribute that returns a tuple `(n, n)`, so accessing `expr.shape[0]` is correct, but we need to ensure this works for symbolic ",
