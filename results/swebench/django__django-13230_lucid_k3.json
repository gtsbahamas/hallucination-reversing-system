However, I can analyze the previous patch and identify the problem based on the code structure.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\nThe previous patch added `comments` parameter to `feed.add_item()`, but there's a critical issue: the `add_item()` method in Django's feed generator doesn't accept a `comments` parameter directly - it expects `item_comments` instead.\n\nLooking at the feedgenerator API (which is what `feed.add_item()` calls), the parameter name should be `comments`, but we need to verify this matches what the feed generator actually expects.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. The issue description mentions that \"comments is already explicitly mentioned in the feedparser\" - this suggests the feed generator does support comments\n2.
