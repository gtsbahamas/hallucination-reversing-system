      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and why the test failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue is that on M1 Macs (and other HiDPI displays), the MacOSX backend doubles the DPI when creating a canvas. When a figure is pickled and unpickled:\n\n1. The figure is pickled with its current (doubled) DPI\n2. On unpickling, a new canvas is created, which doubles the DPI again\n3. This creates an exponential DPI growth\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch attempted to:\n1. Remove `_original_dpi` from the pickled state\n2. Store `_original_dpi` after unpickling with the value from `state['_dpi']`\n\n**The fundamental flaw**: The patch stores `_original_dpi` AFTER the canvas is created. By that point, the DPI has already been doubled by the backend. So `state['_dpi']` contains the already-doubled value, and storing it as `_original_dpi` doesn't help - it just preserves the doubled value for the next pickle/unpickle cycle.\n\n## Th",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Timing issue**: The patch tries to save `original_dpi` from `state.get('_dpi')` BEFORE calling `self.__dict__ = state`, but at that point `state` is the pickled state dictionary, not the object's `__dict__`. The value should be extracted from `state` before it's assigned.\n\n2. **Logic error**: The patch saves `original_dpi = state.get('_dpi')` but this gets the pickled DPI value (which is already doubled). Then after the canvas is created (which doubles it again), it tries to restore this already-doubled value, which doesn't fix anything.\n\n3. **Missing the actual fix**: The patch removes `_original_dpi` from the pickled state but doesn't properly use it. The key insight from the hints is that `_original_dpi` should store the ACTUAL original DPI (before any HiDPI doubling), and we should restore the figure's DPI to this value after unpickling.\n\n## ",

The patch tried to store `_original_dpi` in `__getstate__` but only if it didn't already exist\n2. It then tried to restore this in `__setstate__` after the canvas was created\n3. **Critical flaw**: The canvas creation itself (`new_figure_manager_given_figure`) reads `self._dpi` and may double it for HiDPI displays. By the time we try to restore `original_dpi`, the damage is already done - the canvas was created with the already-doubled DPI\n\n**The core issue:**\n- On HiDPI displays (like M1 Macs), when a canvas is created, it reads the figure's `_dpi` and may scale it (e.g., 2x for retina displays)\n- When pickling, we save this already-scaled DPI\n- When unpickling, the canvas creation reads this scaled DPI and scales it AGAIN\n- This compounds on each pickle/unpickle cycle\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Key insight from test name:** `test_unpickle_with_device_",
