      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and why the test failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n**The Core Issue:**\nWhen `TEST['MIGRATE']` is `False`, the code should skip migrations but still create all necessary database tables. The error shows that `django_admin_log` table doesn't exist, which means tables aren't being created properly.\n\n**What the Previous Patch Did:**\nThe patch attempted to mock `MIGRATION_MODULES` by setting it to `{app_label: None}` for all apps, then calling `migrate` with `run_syncdb=True`. This approach should theoretically work because:\n1. Setting `MIGRATION_MODULES[app] = None` tells Django to treat that app as having no migrations\n2. `run_syncdb=True` should create tables directly from models\n\n**Why It Failed:**\nThe test failure suggests the patch didn't actually execute or there's an issue with how `MIGRATION_MODULES` is being set. Looking at the test output, there's a Docker image build error, which means we can't s",

However, examining the patch logic reveals a critical flaw:\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incorrect condition in `serialize_db_to_string`**: The patch checks `not self.connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('MIGRATE', True)` to determine if all apps should be serialized. However, this logic is backwards for the actual problem.\n\n2. **The real issue**: When `MIGRATE=False`, the code:\n   - Correctly creates tables via `run_syncdb=True` with mocked `MIGRATION_MODULES`\n   - BUT in `serialize_db_to_string()`, it still checks `app_config.label in loader.migrated_apps`\n   - Since no migrations ran, `loader.migrated_apps` is empty\n   - So `get_objects()` yields nothing, even though tables exist\n   - This causes the serialization to try querying tables that exist bu",
