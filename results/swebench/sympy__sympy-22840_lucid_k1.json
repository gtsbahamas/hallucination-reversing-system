      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch attempted to prevent `MatrixSymbol` instances from being treated as CSE candidates by checking `isinstance(expr, MatrixSymbol)` in two places within the `tree_cse` function. However, this approach has a fundamental flaw.\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Wrong Target**: The patch tried to exclude `MatrixSymbol` objects themselves (like `a` and `b`), but the actual problem is with **indexed MatrixSymbol expressions** (like `a[0, 0]`, `b[1, 2]`).\n\n2. **Misunderstanding the Issue**: Looking at the problematic output from the issue:\n   - `(x0, a)` - This treats the entire MatrixSymbol `a` as a subexpression\n   - `(x1, x0[0, 0])` - Then it extracts individual elements from `x0`\n   \n   The problem isn't that `MatrixSymbol` is being treated as a CSE candidate per se, but that when you have expressions like `a[i, j]` (which are `MatrixElement` objects in SymPy's internal representation), the CSE algorithm is incorrectly treating the base `Matri",
