The ResolverMatch's args/kwargs represent URL-captured parameters, not the partial's pre-filled arguments.\n\n2. **Stored the partial as `self.func`**: While this preserves the partial object, it doesn't help with the `__repr__()` issue since `_func_path` is computed from the unwrapped function but `__repr__()` uses `_func_path` which won't show the partial nature.\n\n3. **The core issue wasn't addressed**: The `__repr__()` method uses `self._func_path` which is computed during `__init__`, but the patch doesn't actually improve how partials are represented in the output.\n\n## Key Insights from Issue Description\n\nThe issue states:\n- `__repr__()` shows `functools.partial` which isn't helpful\n- W",

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, it appears there was an infrastructure issue (Docker image not found) rather than a test failure from the code itself. However, I can analyze the previous patch to identify potential issues.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch correctly unwrapped `functools.partial` objects to get the underlying function, but it had a critical flaw:\n\n**The issue**: When the unwrapped function is a class-based view (doesn't have `__name__`), the code still references `unwrapped_func.__class__` instead of the original `func.__class__`. This is problematic because:\n\n1. If `func` is a `functools.partial` wrapping a **function**, then `unwrapped_func` is that function\n2. But if `func` is a `functools.partial` wrapping a **class instance** (CBV), then `unwrapped_func.func` would be the class instance, and we'd need to access its class correctly\n\n### The Core Problem\n\nThe logic incorrectly assumes that after unwrapping, we can always use `unwrapp",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch only unwrapped `functools.partial` for computing `_func_path`, but it didn't handle the partial's pre-filled arguments. The issue description explicitly states: \"Because a partial function also has arguments provided up front, we need to handle those specially so that they are accessible in __repr__.\"\n\nThe patch modified how `_func_path` is computed but left `self.func` as the partial object. This means:\n1. `__repr__()` still shows `functools.partial` in the output\n2. The pre-filled arguments from the partial are not merged into `self.args` and `self.kwargs`\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nThe issue says \"ISTM that we can simply unwrap functools.partial objects in ResolverMatch.__init__().\" This means we should:\n1. Extract the underlying function from the partial\n2. Merge the partial's pre-filled arguments with the resolver's args/k",
