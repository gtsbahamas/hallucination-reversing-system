      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format**. The issue was that I included two separate patches in the same diff block, which caused the patch application to fail. Specifically:\n\n1. The first hunk modified lines around 1938 (in `Integer.__pow__`)\n2. The second hunk tried to modify lines around 1564 (in `Rational.__pow__`)\n3. These were presented as separate patches but in a confusing format\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nLooking at the issue more carefully:\n\n1. **The problem**: `(-2)**(-S(10)/3)` evaluates to `-(-2)**(2/3)/16` instead of the correct principal branch value\n2. **Why it happens**: When `Rational.__pow__` encounters a negative base with a non-integer rational exponent, it extracts the sign incorrectly\n3. **The key code**: In `Rational.__pow__` around line 1567-1569, there's logic that extracts the sign for powers when `expt.q == 2` (square roots), but doesn't handle other cases properly\n\n## The Fix Plan\n\nThe fix should be ",
