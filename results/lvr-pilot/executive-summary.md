# LVR Pilot: Executive Summary

**LUCID Verified Reconstruction — First Real-World Deployment**

---

## The Problem

AI-generated code ships with hidden bugs. Traditional testing catches syntax errors and crashes, but misses deeper issues: misconfigured permissions, inconsistent business logic, and placeholder features marketed as complete. These bugs are invisible during development and only surface in production — when they cost the most.

## What We Did

We ran **LVR Loop 1** (Requirements Extraction & Verification) against the accounting domain of a real, production-scale ERP application:

- **1,271+ TypeScript files** across 60+ routes and 23 user roles
- **Scope:** 25 accounting page components using 26 database tables
- **Method:** Extracted 354 verifiable claims from code, then verified each against the actual codebase with file-and-line-number evidence

## What We Found

| | |
|---|---|
| **354 claims** verified | 87.6% correct, 7.9% falsified |
| **23 unique bugs** discovered | 2 critical, 6 high, 15 medium/low |
| **$0 false positives** | Every bug traceable to actual code |

### The Headline Bug

**A critical permission misconfiguration blocks 4 financial roles (finance_manager, accountant, AR specialist, AP specialist) from accessing ANY accounting page.** The navigation menu shows these users clickable links — but clicking leads to "Access Denied."

This bug exists because the application has **three independent permission systems** that use different naming conventions and make contradictory decisions. No individual system is broken — the bug only appears when you trace a permission check across all three.

Standard testing would never find this: admin accounts bypass the check, unit tests don't cross-reference three files, and QA testers typically use admin credentials.

**LVR found it in minutes** by systematically verifying each permission claim across the full codebase.

### Other Findings

- **Data integrity bugs:** Journal entry "Post" and "Reverse" buttons bypass the validation service, allowing entries to be posted without balance verification or creating reversing entries
- **Inconsistent behavior:** Deleting a bill from the detail page permanently destroys it; deleting from the list page soft-archives it
- **10 placeholder features** marketed as buttons but showing "Coming Soon" toasts or doing nothing when clicked
- **Dashboard shows fake data:** The main Financial Management overview displays hardcoded mock numbers

## Why This Matters

### For Engineering Teams
LVR catches the bugs that ship because nobody tests across file boundaries. It's not a linter or a type checker — it's a systematic verification that asks "does this code actually do what it claims to do?" for every observable behavior.

### For Business Leaders
Every placeholder button and broken permission is a support ticket waiting to happen. LVR quantifies technical debt with evidence, not estimates. This pilot found 23 bugs in 25 pages — roughly **1 bug per page** in an AI-generated codebase.

### For Investors
LUCID's RLVF experiments proved that verification quality can't be baked into models (negative scaling with more data). This means verification is a **permanent infrastructure need** — not a temporary gap that model improvements will close. LVR is the productized form of that insight.

## Unit Economics

| Service Tier | Price | Margin |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LVR Assessment (single domain) | $2,500 - $5,000 | 80%+ |
| Full Reconstruction (multi-domain) | $10,000 - $50,000 | 70%+ |
| GitHub Action (ongoing PR verification) | $29 - $99/team/mo | 60-90% |

The assessment tier demonstrated here costs ~$100 in API compute and produces a deliverable worth $2,500+ to the customer (23 bugs with evidence and fix recommendations).

## Next Steps

1. **Expand to full application** — Apply LVR to all 60+ routes (est. 100+ additional bugs)
2. **LVR Loop 2** — Verified architecture extraction (are the domain boundaries correct?)
3. **LVR Loop 3** — Verified code regeneration (generate clean code from verified requirements)
4. **Productize** — Package as assessment service + GitHub Action
