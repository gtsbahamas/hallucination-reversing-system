## ACC-009: Financial Management (Overview Dashboard)

**Route:** /accounting
**Component:** src/pages/FinancialManagement.tsx
**Guard:** accounting.invoices.read (via ROUTE_PERMISSION_MAP['accounting'])

### Roles
- Full access (bypass): super_admin, owner, operations_manager
- Navigation-level: FINANCIAL_ROLES = ['super_admin', 'owner', 'finance_manager', 'accountant', 'ar_specialist', 'ap_specialist'], requiredPermissions: ['financial.ar.view', 'financial.ap.view']
- Route guard resolves to: DENIED for all non-FULL_ACCESS_ROLES (accounting.invoices.read not in permissionMappings.ts)

### Database
- Primary: None (overview tab uses hardcoded mock data)
- Joins: None
- Filters: None

### Behavior
1. Page renders a tabbed layout with 6 top-level tabs: Overview, General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Banking & Cash, Compliance & Planning
2. Default tab is "overview" which displays 4 summary stat cards (Net Worth, Monthly Revenue, Cash Balance, Accounts Receivable)
3. All overview stats are HARDCODED MOCK DATA (financialStats object at line 53-62), not fetched from database
4. Recent transactions list is HARDCODED MOCK DATA (3 transactions at lines 64-68), not fetched from database
5. Quick Actions section has 5 buttons: Create Journal Entry, Create Invoice, Record Expense, Reconcile Bank, Generate Report
6. First 4 quick action buttons navigate to other tabs via setActiveTab(); "Generate Report" button has no onClick handler (variant="outline" only)
7. General Ledger tab has 3 sub-tabs: Chart of Accounts, Journal Entries, Financial Reports (lazy-loaded components)
8. Accounts Receivable tab has 4 sub-tabs: Customer Invoices, Subscriptions, Collections Management, Aging Reports (lazy-loaded)
9. Accounts Payable tab has 3 sub-tabs: Vendor Bills, Payment Management, Expense Tracking
10. AP "Vendor Bills" and "Payment Management" sub-tabs both render the same AccountsPayableTab component
11. Banking & Cash tab has 4 sub-tabs: Bank Reconciliation, Cash Flow Analysis, Multi-Currency, POS End of Day (lazy-loaded)
12. Compliance & Planning tab has 3 sub-tabs: Tax Reporting, Budget Analysis, Fixed Assets (lazy-loaded)
13. All sub-tab components are lazy-loaded with React.lazy() and wrapped in Suspense with a TabLoader fallback

### Scaffolding Flags
- MOCK DATA: financialStats object (lines 53-62) uses hardcoded values, comment says "replace with real data from hooks"
- MOCK DATA: recentTransactions array (lines 64-68) uses hardcoded values
- DEAD HANDLER: "Generate Report" button (line 190-193) has no onClick handler, does nothing when clicked
- DUPLICATE RENDER: AP "Vendor Bills" and "Payment Management" sub-tabs both render AccountsPayableTab (lines 336-339 and 342-345)
