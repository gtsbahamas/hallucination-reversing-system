## ACC-025: Banking & Cash

**Route:** /accounting/banking-cash
**Component:** src/pages/accounting/BankingAndCashPage.tsx
**Guard:** accounting.invoices.read (via ROUTE_PERMISSION_MAP['accounting'])

### Roles
- Full access (bypass): super_admin, owner, operations_manager
- Navigation-level: No entry in NAVIGATION_PERMISSIONS
- Route guard resolves to: DENIED for all non-FULL_ACCESS_ROLES

### Database
- Inherits from child tabs: bank_transactions, bank_statements, bank_accounts (Bank Reconciliation), cash_flow_categories, cash_flow_transactions (Cash Flow), currencies (Multi-Currency), plus POS End of Day tables

### Behavior
1. Page uses DashboardLayout with Landmark icon and title "Banking & Cash Management"
2. Four sub-tabs: "Bank Reconciliation", "Cash Flow", "Multi-Currency", "POS End of Day"
3. Each tab content wrapped in React Suspense with fallback loading spinner (Loader2 icon)
4. Bank Reconciliation tab: renders BankReconciliationTab component (see ACC-016)
5. Cash Flow tab: renders CashFlowTab component (see ACC-019)
6. Multi-Currency tab: renders MultiCurrencyTab component (see ACC-022)
7. POS End of Day tab: renders POSEndOfDayContent component (imported from pos module)
8. Tab state managed via useState, defaults to "bank-reconciliation"
9. Uses shadcn Tabs component with TabsList/TabsTrigger/TabsContent pattern

### Scaffolding Flags
- This is a pure composition page — no unique logic beyond tab orchestration
- All bugs and scaffolding from child tabs (ACC-016, ACC-019, ACC-022) apply here
- POSEndOfDayContent component not analyzed in this batch (belongs to POS module)
- Suspense fallback is visual-only; no error boundary for failed lazy loads
