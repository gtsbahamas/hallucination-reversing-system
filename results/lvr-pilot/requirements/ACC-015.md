## ACC-015: Financial Reports

**Route:** /accounting/financial-reports
**Component:** src/pages/accounting/FinancialReportsPage.tsx (thin wrapper around FinancialReportsTab)
**Guard:** accounting.invoices.read (via ROUTE_PERMISSION_MAP['accounting'])

### Roles
- Full access (bypass): super_admin, owner, operations_manager
- Navigation-level: FINANCIAL_ROLES, requiredPermissions: ['financial.reports.view']
- Route guard resolves to: DENIED for all non-FULL_ACCESS_ROLES (accounting.invoices.read not in permissionMappings.ts)

### Database
- Primary: Depends on sub-tab (each report component queries its own data)
- This tab component itself makes no database queries — it orchestrates 5 sub-components

### Behavior
1. Page is a thin wrapper: renders DashboardLayout > heading > FinancialReportsTab
2. FinancialReportsTab renders a Card with 5 sub-tabs: Enhanced Reports, Cash Flow, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Trial Balance
3. Default tab is "enhanced" (EnhancedFinancialReportsDashboard)
4. Enhanced Reports tab has a "New" badge indicator
5. Sub-components: EnhancedFinancialReportsDashboard, CashFlowStatement, IncomeStatement, BalanceSheet, TrialBalance
6. All 5 sub-components are directly imported (NOT lazy-loaded, unlike other tabs in the system)
7. Tab icons: Enhanced=Star, Cash Flow=TrendingUp, Income Statement=PieChart, Balance Sheet=BarChart3, Trial Balance=FileText

### Scaffolding Flags
- None found at this orchestration level. Each sub-report component (CashFlowStatement, IncomeStatement, BalanceSheet, TrialBalance, EnhancedFinancialReportsDashboard) would need individual verification to check for scaffolding.
- NOT LAZY-LOADED: Unlike other tab components in the system, these 5 are directly imported. This means all 5 report components load eagerly when the tab is first rendered, potentially impacting performance.
