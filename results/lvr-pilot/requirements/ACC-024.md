## ACC-024: Compliance Planning

**Route:** /accounting/compliance-planning
**Component:** src/pages/accounting/CompliancePlanningPage.tsx
**Guard:** accounting.invoices.read (via ROUTE_PERMISSION_MAP['accounting'])

### Roles
- Full access (bypass): super_admin, owner, operations_manager
- Navigation-level: No entry in NAVIGATION_PERMISSIONS
- Route guard resolves to: DENIED for all non-FULL_ACCESS_ROLES

### Database
- Inherits from child tabs: invoices, expenses, account_transactions (Tax Reporting), budgets, budget_line_items (Budget Analysis), fixed_assets (Fixed Assets)

### Behavior
1. Page uses DashboardLayout with FileCheck icon and title "Compliance Planning"
2. Three sub-tabs: "Tax Reporting", "Budget Analysis", "Fixed Assets"
3. Each tab content wrapped in React Suspense with fallback loading spinner (Loader2 icon)
4. Tax Reporting tab: renders TaxReportingTab component (see ACC-017)
5. Budget Analysis tab: renders BudgetAnalysisTab component (see ACC-018)
6. Fixed Assets tab: renders FixedAssetsTab component (see ACC-020/ACC-021)
7. Tab state managed via useState, defaults to "tax-reporting"
8. Uses shadcn Tabs component with TabsList/TabsTrigger/TabsContent pattern

### Scaffolding Flags
- This is a pure composition page — no unique logic beyond tab orchestration
- All bugs and scaffolding from child tabs (ACC-017, ACC-018, ACC-021) apply here
- Suspense fallback is visual-only; no error boundary for failed lazy loads
