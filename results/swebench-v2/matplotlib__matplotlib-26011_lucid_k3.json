      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure and the previous patch, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Equality comparison bug**: The line `if emit and emit != _NoRecursionMarker(self):` creates a NEW instance of `_NoRecursionMarker` each time for comparison. Since dataclass instances are compared by value (and each has a different `event_src`), this comparison will always be True even when `emit` IS a `_NoRecursionMarker` instance.\n\n2. **Logic error**: The condition `if not isinstance(emit, _NoRecursionMarker)` inside the loop means we only set `emit = _NoRecursionMarker(self)` when emit is NOT already a marker. But we want to pass the SAME marker through the chain to track the original source.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe core insight is that we need to:\n1. **Track the original event source** through the recursion chain\n2. **Only emit callbacks once per original event** - on the axis where the change originated\n3. **Prevent infinite recursion** by not re-emitting on sibli",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Logic Error in Callback Processing**: The patch has a critical flaw in the condition check:\n   ```python\n   if emit and not isinstance(emit, _NoRecursionMarker):\n       self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)\n   ```\n   This means callbacks are **only** processed when `emit=True` AND it's NOT a `_NoRecursionMarker`. But when recursing to siblings, we pass `emit=_NoRecursionMarker(self)`, which means the callbacks won't fire on sibling axes - **this is the exact bug we're trying to fix!**\n\n2. **Duplicate `if emit:` blocks**: The patch has two consecutive `if emit:` blocks, which is redundant and confusing.\n\n3. **Incorrect recursion prevention**: The marker check should prevent infinite recursion by checking if we're being called FROM a specific source, not preventing callbacks entirely.\n\n## The Fix Plan\n\nThe correct logic should be:\n\n1. **Always process callbacks",
