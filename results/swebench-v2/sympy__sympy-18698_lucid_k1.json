      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n### 1. **Wrong Approach - Operating on Expressions Instead of Polynomials**\nThe previous patch tried to combine factors by multiplying them as `Mul(*factors_list)`, which creates a symbolic expression. However, `sqf_list` should return polynomial objects (or expressions that can be converted to polynomials), not arbitrary multiplied expressions.\n\n### 2. **Type Inconsistency**\nThe factors returned by `_generic_factor_list` are expressions, but when we multiply them with `Mul()`, we lose the polynomial structure. The correct approach is to multiply them as polynomials and then convert back.\n\n### 3. **Missing the Core Issue**\nLooking at the issue description, the problem is that `sqf_list()` function doesn't combine factors of the same multiplicity, while `Poly.sqf_list()` method does. The fix should make the function behave like the method.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n### Key Ins",
