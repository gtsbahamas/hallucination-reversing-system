The issue is that I included explanatory text and multiple patch attempts in the previous response, which confused the patch parser.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n1. The patch format was malformed - it contained multiple patch blocks and explanatory text mixed in\n2. The patch tried to add methods that were incomplete or had syntax errors\n3. It attempted to add a `resolve_model_reference` method that was already part of existing code\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\nThe core issue is that when `order_with_respect_to` is set on a model:\n1. Django's `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation creates an implicit `_order` field\n2. If indexes or constraints reference `_order`, they're added via `AddIndex`/`AddConstraint` operations\n3. These operations are generated in the wrong order - `AddIndex`/`AddConstraint` come before `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`\n4. This causes a crash because `_order` doesn't ex",

The issue is that the patch is trying to add code in the middle of an existing function call without properly closing it. Specifically:\n\n```python\noperations.AddIndex(\n    model_name=model_name,\n    index=index,\n),\ndependencies=self._get_dependencies_for_index_or_constraint(  # <-- This is outside the add_operation() call!\n```\n\nThe `dependencies` parameter is being added **after** the closing parenthesis and comma of the `operations.AddIndex()` call, making it appear outside the `self.add_operation()` function call.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe previous patch attempted to add a `dependencies` parameter to `self.add_operation()` calls for `AddIndex` and `AddConstraint` operations. However, the diff format was malformed - it didn't properly show the complete context of where the `dependencies` parameter should be inserted within the `add",

Looking at the patch, the issue is clear:\n\n```diff\n                    operations.AddIndex(\n                        model_name=model_name,\n                        index=index,\n                    ),\n+                    dependencies=dependencies,\n                 )\n```\n\nThe problem is that `operations.AddIndex(...)` ends with a closing parenthesis and comma on line 4, but then we're trying to add `dependencies=dependencies,` after it. This creates invalid Python syntax - we can't add a parameter after the function call has already been closed.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `self.add_operation()` method is being called, and we're trying to pass `dependencies` as a keyword argument. However, the patch incorrectly places the `dependencies` parameter **outside** the `operations.AddIndex()` call but tries to add it as if it were inside.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to pass `dependencies` to the `self.add_ope",
