This is correct in principle - we want to compute labels using the best parameters. However, the patch has a critical bug:\n\nThe `_e_step()` call was moved to after `_set_parameters(best_params)`, but it's placed AFTER the convergence warning and parameter setting. The issue is that when `n_init > 1`, the loop variable `init` in the warning message will always reference the LAST iteration (not necessarily the best one), which is misleading.\n\nMore importantly, looking at the code flow:\n1. The loop runs `n_init` times\n2. After the loop ends, `init` variable holds the value from the LAST iteration\n3. The warning uses `init + 1`, which will always show the last initialization number\n\nBut the real problem causing test failure is likely that the `_e_step()` is ",

When `n_init > 1`, multiple initializations are tried\n2. After all iterations complete, `best_params` are restored via `_set_parameters(best_params)`\n3. The patch then calls `_e_step(X)` which uses these best parameters\n4. However, `predict(X)` also uses these same best parameters\n5. So both should agree... but the test still fails\n\n**The actual bug:** Looking more carefully at the code flow, the issue is that the patch moved `_e_step()` but didn't account for the fact that when `n_init > 1`, the loop continues and may overwrite the model state.
