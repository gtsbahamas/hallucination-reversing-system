      "remediation": "Looking at the test results, the patch failed to apply because it's missing a newline at the end. The error message \"patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line\" indicates a formatting issue with the diff.\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch file itself had a formatting issue - it was missing a trailing newline, causing the patch to fail to apply\n2. The logic itself appears correct: changing from `is None` to `in field.empty_values` to handle empty strings\n\n**Why this fix is needed:**\n- When a `CharField` primary key is initially empty (`\"\"`), it's not `None`\n- The current code only checks `is None`, so it doesn't recognize `\"\"` as an empty value\n- This means when `order.product = Product()` is assigned (with an empty string PK), and then `order.product.sku = \"foo\"` is set, the order's `product_id` field retains the empty string\n- Using `field.empty_values` (which includes `None`, `\"\"`, and other empty values) will properly detect when the FK field needs ",
