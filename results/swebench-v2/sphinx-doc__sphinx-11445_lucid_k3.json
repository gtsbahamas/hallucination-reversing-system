      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format**. The issue is in the diff structure - there's an inconsistency in how the changes are presented:\n\n1. Line 18 of the patch shows: `content.insert(pos + lineno + 1, '', '<generated>', 0)` with a `+` prefix\n2. But this line already exists in the original code (line 91)\n3. The patch then tries to add a comment and additional logic, but the format is broken because it's treating an existing line as a new addition\n\nThe patch structure is incorrect - it should show the context around the change properly, not mark an existing line as new.\n\n### Root Cause of the Bug\n\nFrom the issue description and hints:\n- When `rst_prolog` is set, it's prepended directly to the RST content\n- If a document starts with a heading containing a domain directive (e.g., `:mod:`mypackage2``), the prolog gets inserted between the heading text and its underline\n- This breaks the heading structure beca",

The patch had incorrect context lines - it showed lines that should remain unchanged but didn't properly format them as context (they should be prefixed with a space, not indented).\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Diff Format Error**: The patch included lines like `# insert prolog (after docinfo if exists)` without proper context markers, causing the patch to be rejected\n2. **Conceptual Issue**: Even if the format were correct, adding TWO blank lines (`pos + lineno + 2`) after the prolog is likely excessive and not the right solution\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nLooking at the `prepend_prolog` function:\n- It inserts the prolog content at position `pos`\n- After inserting all prolog lines, it adds ONE blank line at `pos + lineno + 1`\n- The issue is that when a document starts with a role like `:mod:`mypackage2`\\n=================`, the prolog gets inserted between the role text and the underline, breaking the heading\n\n##",
