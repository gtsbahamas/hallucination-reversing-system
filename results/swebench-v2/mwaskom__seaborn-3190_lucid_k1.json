      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe patch attempted to convert `vmin` and `vmax` to float before passing them to the `forward` transform function. However, this is insufficient because:\n\n1. The `forward` function itself may be receiving boolean arrays/values throughout the pipeline, not just at the normalization step\n2. The conversion happens too late - after `axis.convert_units()` which may preserve boolean types\n3. The real issue is that boolean data needs to be converted to numeric (0/1) **before** any mathematical operations occur in the transform pipeline\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\n\nThe test `test_interval_with_bools` is specifically testing boolean data handling. The error occurs because:\n- Boolean data (`[True, False]`) flows through the scale setup\n- When computing normalization bounds, `forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)` fails because numpy booleans don't sup",
