      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with Previous Patch\n\n1. **Length check in wrong location**: The check `if original_len is not None and len(seq) != original_len` is inside the loop but only executes when an item is about to be yielded (when `s` is not in `seen`). This means if the list is modified but the next item was already seen, the check won't trigger.\n\n2. **TypeError handling is broken**: When a `TypeError` occurs, the code tries to access variable `s` which may not be defined if the error happens before the loop starts. The recursive call `for s in uniq(seq, result)` will re-iterate from the beginning, yielding duplicates.\n\n3. **Iterator consumption issue**: After a `TypeError`, if `seq` doesn't have `__getitem__`, the code tries to iterate over `seq` again, but `seq` (as an iterator) may already be partially consumed.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Move the length check**: Check the length at the **start of each loop iteration**, n",
