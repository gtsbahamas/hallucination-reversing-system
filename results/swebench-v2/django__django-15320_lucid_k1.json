The patch had two attempts shown, and the second one had a malformed line ending (\"Wait, I need to also set `subquery = True`. Let me revise:\").\n\nLooking at the issue and the code structure, the problem is clear:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `Subquery` class doesn't set `subquery = True` on its query object, causing `as_sql()` to incorrectly strip the first and last characters instead of wrapping in parentheses.\n\n2. **What the previous patch tried to do**: \n   - Clone the query (good idea to avoid mutating the original)\n   - Set `queryset.subquery = True` (correct fix)\n\n3. **Why it failed**: The diff was malformed with extra text and improper formatting.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Clone the query object** before modifying it (as suggested in the hints to avoid mutating the original query)\n2. **Set `subquery = True`** on the cloned query object\n3. **Apply to both branches** - when `queryset` ",
