This is a formatting issue, not a logic issue.\n\nLooking at the patch content, the logic appears sound:\n1. Extract the base language from the language code (e.g., 'de' from 'de-at')\n2. Check if either the full language code OR the base language is in available_tags\n3. Only raise E004 if neither is available\n\nThis aligns with Django's documented behavior of falling back to base languages.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe patch logic is correct but needs proper formatting. The fix should:\n\n1. **Properly format the diff** - ensure all lines are complete and the patch structure is valid\n2. **Maintain the logic** from the previous attempt:\n   - Split language_code on '-' to get base language\n   - Convert to lowercase for comparison\n   - Check both full code and base language against available_tags\n\nThe corrected patch should look like:\n\n```python\n@register(Tags.translation)\ndef ",

      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format** - the diff was corrupted with line breaks in the middle of the code. The patch never actually got applied to test the logic.\n\nHowever, looking at the logic itself, there's also a **conceptual issue**: The patch only extracts the base language from `LANGUAGE_CODE` but doesn't check if any of the `available_tags` could be base languages that match. For example:\n- If `LANGUAGE_CODE = \"de-at\"` and `available_tags = {\"de\", \"en-us\"}`, we need to check if \"de\" (the base) is in available_tags\n- But if `LANGUAGE_CODE = \"de\"` and `available_tags = {\"de-de\", \"en-us\"}`, we also need to check if any available tag has \"de\" as its base\n\nThe current patch only handles the first case.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Fix the patch format**: Ensure proper indentation and no line breaks in the middle of statements\n\n2. **Improve the logic** to handle Django's fallback behavior correctly:\n   - Extract base language from `LANGUAGE_CODE` (e.g., \"de",

      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed because it has a logical flaw in how it handles the base language check. Let me analyze the issue:\n\n**Problem with the previous patch:**\n1. The patch splits the language code and checks if any available tag has the same base language\n2. However, it's doing a case-insensitive comparison (`lower()`) on both sides, which is correct\n3. But the main issue is that it's checking `tag.split('-')[0].lower()` for ALL tags in `available_tags`, which means if ANY tag shares the same base language, it returns success\n\n**What the test likely expects:**\nLooking at the test name `test_valid_variant_consistent_language_settings`, it's testing that a variant like `de-at` should be valid when `de` (the base language) is available in `LANGUAGES`.\n\n**The actual bug:**\nThe logic seems correct in principle, but there might be an issue with how we're extracting and comparing the base language. The problem could be:\n1. The comparison might not be handling the language cod",
