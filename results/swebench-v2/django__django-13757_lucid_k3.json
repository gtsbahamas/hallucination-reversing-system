This is a formatting issue with the diff itself.\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch file is malformed/truncated - it ends abruptly without completing the last line\n2. The logic approach was correct but the implementation had issues:\n   - For `as_sqlite`: Simply replacing `' IS NOT NULL'` with `' IS NULL'` is fragile and assumes a specific string format\n   - The approach of always calling `HasKey` and then modifying the result is sound\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n- When `__isnull=True` is used on a KeyTransform, it should only match objects that **do not have the key**\n- Currently on SQLite and Oracle, it incorrectly also matches objects where the key exists but has JSON `null` value\n- The fix needs to distinguish between:\n  - Key doesn't exist (should match for `isnull=True`)\n  - Key exists with JSON null v",

The line appears to be truncated in the middle of accessing an attribute on `self.lhs`.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the issue by:\n1.
