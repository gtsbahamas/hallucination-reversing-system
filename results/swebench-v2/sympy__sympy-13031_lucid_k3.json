The patch was attempting to:\n\n1. Remove the `col_join` method from `SparseMatrix`\n2. Add a new `_eval_col_join` method instead\n\nHowever, the patch was truncated and incomplete.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nFrom the issue description and code context:\n\n1. **The Problem**: `SparseMatrix.hstack()` with zero-row matrices returns incorrect column counts (e.g., `(0, 3)` instead of `(0, 6)`)\n\n2. **Why It Happens**: The issue mentions that `SparseMatrix` implements `col_join` directly instead of `_eval_col_join`. When `hstack` is called, it uses the matrix joining operations, but `SparseMatrix.col_join` has special handling that doesn't work correctly with zero-row matrices.\n\n3. **The Fix That Worked for Dense Matrices**: Dense matrices were fixed by implementing `_eval_col_join` instead of overriding `col_join` directly.
