The patch used `is not` to compare norm objects, which checks object identity rather than type equality\n2. When `mappable.autoscale()` is called, it may create a new norm instance even if it's the same type, causing unnecessary resets\n3. The condition `if self.norm is not mappable.norm` would trigger even when just updating vmin/vmax on the same norm type\n4. This causes the locator/formatter to be reset unnecessarily, leading to issues when the colorbar tries to update\n\n**Key insights from test output and issue:**\n1. The real problem is that when the norm **type** changes (e.g., `Normalize` \u2192 `LogNorm`), the colorbar needs to update its locator/formatter\n2. The colorbar's `self.norm` reference needs to stay synchronized with `mappable.norm`\n3. Simply checking object identity (`is not`) is too aggressive - we need to check if the norm **type*",

Setting `self.norm = mappable.norm` in `on_mappable_changed()`\n2. Resetting `self._locator` and `self._formatter` to `None`\n\nHowever, this approach has a critical flaw: **it doesn't update the colorbar's internal locator to match the new norm type**.

The error occurs in `_ticker()` when it tries to call the locator with incompatible data\n2. When switching from `LogNorm` back to `Normalize`, the colorbar still has a `LogLocator` which raises `ValueError: Data has no positive values, and therefore can not be log-scaled`\n3. The",
