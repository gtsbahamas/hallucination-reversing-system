This is problematic because:\n\n1. **Empty key doesn't make sense**: When recursing into list/tuple items, we're not dealing with key-value pairs anymore. The items themselves might be dictionaries (which have their own keys), or they might be other nested structures.\n\n2. **Loss of context for nested dictionaries**: When a list contains dictionaries like `[{\"secret\": \"value\"}]`, we need to check each dictionary's keys against the `hidden_settings` pattern. By passing an empty string, we lose the ability to properly cleanse dictionary keys within the list.\n\n3. **The key parameter's purpose**: The `key` parameter is meant to be checked against `hidden_settings` regex.

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incomplete recursion**: The patch only handles one level of nesting for lists/tuples. It checks `if not isinstance(item, dict)` but doesn't recursively handle nested lists/tuples within lists/tuples (like the `else` field in the example which has lists within lists).\n\n2. **Inconsistent key handling**: When processing list/tuple items, it passes an empty string `''` as the key for non-dict items. This means nested sensitive keys won't be detected by `self.hidden_settings.search(key)`.\n\n3. **Redundant dict handling**: The patch duplicates dict comprehension logic inline instead of recursively calling `cleanse_setting` for all items uniformly.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test `test_cleanse_setting_recurses_in_list_tuples` is failing, which confirms the issue is with recursive cleansing of nested structures.
