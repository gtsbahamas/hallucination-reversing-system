However, somewhere in the code flow, these tuples are being iterated over or unpacked incorrectly, causing individual elements like `'1'` to be treated as column names instead of the full tuple `('A', '1')`.\n\nLooking at the error `KeyError: \"['1'] not in index\"`, the `['1']` suggests that `var` is being passed as a list containing the string `'1'`, not as a tuple.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue is likely in how the variables are being stored or passed around.

The problem is that:\n\n- For MultiIndex columns, `df[('A', '1')]` works correctly\n- But `df.loc[:, ('A', '1')]` may not work the same way in all pandas versions\n- The issue is that we need to handle",
