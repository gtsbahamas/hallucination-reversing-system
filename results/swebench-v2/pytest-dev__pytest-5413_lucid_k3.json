      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch simply **deleted the `__str__` method** from `ExceptionInfo`. This causes Python to fall back to `__repr__`, which is the intended behavior according to the discussion. However, the test `test_excinfo_repr_str` is now failing because it expects specific behavior from `str(excinfo)`.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test failure indicates that `test_excinfo_repr_str` exists and validates the behavior of both `repr()` and `str()` on `ExceptionInfo` objects. The test is likely checking that:\n1. `repr(excinfo)` returns something like `<ExceptionInfo LookupError tblen=X>`\n2. `str(excinfo)` previously returned a formatted location string\n\nSince we're removing `__str__`, the test expectations need to be updated to reflect the new behavior where `str(excinfo)` will now return the same as `repr(excinfo)`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Keep the code change",

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, I can see the issue with the previous patch:\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe previous patch modified the test `test_excinfo_repr_str()` to check that `repr(excinfo) == str(excinfo)`, but this test is **failing** because after removing the `__str__` method, Python falls back to the default `object.__str__()` which calls `__repr__()`. However, the test is checking for equality between `repr()` and `str()` output, which should work... but the test is actually erroring out.\n\nLooking more carefully at the test output showing \"error=1\", this suggests the test itself has an error, not just a failure. The issue is likely that the test is trying to use `excinfo` in a context where it expects certain behavior.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. The previous patch correctly **removed the `__str__` method** from `ExceptionInfo` class\n2. The test was rewritten but appears to have an issue\n3. The test needs to verify that without `__str__`, the object falls back to `__repr__`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nTh",
