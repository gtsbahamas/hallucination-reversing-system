      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch attempted to check if `dim / addend_dim` is dimensionless to determine if dimensions are equivalent. However, this approach has a critical flaw:\n\n1. When dividing two dimensions (e.g., `velocity / (acceleration*time)`), the result is a `Dimension` object\n2. The `is_dimensionless()` method likely checks if a dimension equals `Dimension(1)` or has no dimensional components\n3. But `velocity / (acceleration*time)` = `(length/time) / (length/time)` = `1` should be dimensionless, yet the division operation on `Dimension` objects may not simplify automatically to `Dimension(1)`\n\n**The core issue:**\nThe code needs to check if two dimensions are **equivalent** (represent the same physical quantity), not just if they're exactly equal as objects. `velocity` and `acceleration*time` are dimensionally equivalent because:\n- velocity = lengt",
