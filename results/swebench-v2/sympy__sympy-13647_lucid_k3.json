The correct offset should account for the position where we inserted.\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nLooking at the original code more carefully:\n\n```python\ndef entry(i, j):\n    if j < pos:\n        return self[i, j]\n    elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\n        return other[i, j - pos]\n    return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]  # BUG IS HERE\n```\n\nWhen `j >= pos + other.cols`, we're accessing columns from the original matrix that were shifted right by `other.cols` positions. The bug is that we're subtracting `pos` when we shouldn't be.\n\n**Example walkthrough with the issue:**\n- Original matrix M: 6",
