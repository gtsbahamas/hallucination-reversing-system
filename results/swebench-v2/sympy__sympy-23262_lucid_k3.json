The `_print_tuple` method was added in the wrong location - it was placed between the `_kf` dictionary definition and the `_kc` dictionary definition, breaking the class structure\n2. The indentation and placement caused a syntax error in the class definition\n\n**What the test output shows:**\n- The patch caused an error during evaluation (error=1), meaning the code couldn't even run\n- This is a structural/syntax issue, not a logic issue\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. The logic of the `_print_tuple` method is correct - it properly handles single-element tuples with trailing comma\n2. The method just needs to be placed in the correct location within the `PythonCodePrinter` class\n3. Looking at the class structure, methods should be defined after the class attributes (`_kf`, `_kc`, etc.)\n\n**Concrete fix:**\n1. Move the `_print_tuple` method to **af",

However, in SymPy's printing system, tuples are represented as `Tuple` objects, not Python tuples, and the method signature/implementation doesn't match how SymPy printers work.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n1. The method tries to use `expr[0]` and `len(expr)` directly, but SymPy's `Tuple` class uses `.args` to access elements\n2. The method doesn't follow SymPy's printer pattern correctly\n3. The test failed with an error (not just a test failure), suggesting a runtime exception\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Access tuple elements via `.args`**: SymPy's `Tuple` class stores its elements in the `.args` attribute, not as direct indexable items\n\n2. **Use proper lengt",

Python's built-in `tuple` type doesn't go through the printer's dispatch mechanism\n2. The issue occurs when `lambdify` receives a Python `tuple([1])`, not a SymPy `Tuple` object\n3. The printer only handles SymPy expression types, not native Python types\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\n- The problem is in how `lambdify` processes Python tuples before they reach the printer\n- When `tuple([1])` is passed to `lambdify`, it needs to be converted to a SymPy `Tuple` object first\n- The workaround mentioned (using `Tuple(*[1])`) works because it creates a SymPy `Tuple` that the printer can handle\n\n**Test failure reason:**\nThe patch didn't actually fix the issue because `_print_tuple` expects a SymPy expression with `.args`, but Python's native `",
