      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format**. The issue is in the diff structure - there are formatting problems that make it unparseable:\n\n1. **Incorrect context lines**: The patch shows changes to `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` but includes unrelated content like \"The message to show the user as reason for the failure.\" as a standalone line\n2. **Unnecessary changes**: The patch modifies multiple files (`outcomes.py`, `skipping.py`, `runner.py`) when only `runner.py` needs to be changed\n3. **Whitespace/formatting issues**: The diff has malformed line markers and context\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nLooking at the actual requirement from the issue and test, we need to:\n\n1. **Only modify `src/_pytest/runner.py`** - specifically the `_check_if_skip_or_exit_pytest` function\n2. **Update the error message** to mention `allow_module_level=True` as suggested in the issue\n3. **Keep the patch minimal** - don't touch other files unnecessarily\n\n## K",
