      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch appears to be malformed/truncated - it duplicates existing methods (`chain()`, `relabeled_clone()`, etc.) that are already in the file\n2. It doesn't actually address the core issue: `QuerySet.none()` on combined queries (union/intersection/difference)\n3. The patch seems to have accidentally included a large chunk of unrelated code\n\n## Root Cause\n\nBased on the issue description and hint, the problem is:\n- When `.none()` is called on a combined queryset (created with `union()`, `intersection()`, or `difference()`), it returns all results instead of an empty queryset\n- This happens because combined queries have special handling that doesn't properly respect the \"none\" state\n\n## Key Insights from Test Context\n\nThe test `test_union_none` likely tests something like:\n```python\nqs = Model.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(Model.objects.filter(id__gt=5))\n",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch tried to clear the combinator state in `QuerySet.none()` by setting:\n- `clone.query.combinator = None`\n- `clone.query.combinator_all = False`  \n- `clone.query.combined_queries = ()`\n\nHowever, this approach is fundamentally flawed because:\n\n1. **It breaks the combined query structure**: When you have a combined query (union/intersection/difference), the combinator and combined_queries are essential to the query's identity. Simply clearing them doesn't create a proper \"none\" query - it just removes the combination aspect.\n\n2. **The real issue is in SQL generation**: The problem isn't in the QuerySet layer but in how the SQL compiler handles `set_empty()` for combined queries. When `set_empty()` is called, it should result in an empty result set, but the SQL compiler for combined queries doesn't respect the empty state.\n\n## Root",
