      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe patch correctly added `\"acsc\"` and `\"asec\"` to the `inv_trig_table` list, but this alone is insufficient. The code that follows needs to actually handle these new entries.\n\n**Key insight from the code structure:**\nLooking at line 743 and the surrounding context, after defining `inv_trig_table`, there must be code that processes these function names. The comment says:\n```python\n# Rewrite asin, acos, atan, acot as arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccot\n```\n\nThis suggests the code transforms function names by prepending \"arc\" to them. However, the transformation logic likely only handles the original 4 functions in the list.\n\n**The actual problem:**\nThe code after line 743 probably checks if the function name is in `inv_trig_table` and then prepends \"arc\" to create the full name. But it's likely doing something like:\n- `\"asin\"` \u2192 `\"arcsin\"` \u2713\n- `\"acos\"`",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Problem with Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch changed the condition from:\n```python\nif name in inv_trig_table:\n```\nto:\n```python\nif func.__name__ in inv_trig_table:\n```\n\nHowever, this is incorrect because:\n1. The variable `name` has already been processed and may have been modified (e.g., stripped of backslashes, converted to different formats)\n2. Using `func.__name__` directly doesn't match against the processed `name` variable that gets the \"arc\" prefix added\n3. The logic adds \"arc\" to `name`, not to `func.__name__`\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the code flow:\n1. `name` is derived from `func` through various transformations\n2. The check `if name in inv_trig_table` compares the **processed name** against the table\n3. Then `name = \"arc\" + name` modifies the **processed name**\n4. But `func.__name__` would be the raw function name like \"acsc\", while `name` at that point might be just \"acsc\" (after processing)\n\nT",

The code does:\n\n```python\nif name in inv_trig_table:\n    name = \"arc\" + name\n```\n\nThis means:\n- `\"acsc\"` becomes `\"arc\" + \"acsc\"` = `\"arcacsc\"` \u274c (should be `\"arccsc\"`)\n- `\"asec\"` becomes `\"arc\" + \"asec\"` = `\"arcasec\"` \u274c (should be `\"arcsec\"`)\n\nThe existing functions work because:\n- `\"asin\"` \u2192 `\"arc\" + \"asin\"` = `\"arcsin\"` \u2713\n- `\"acos\"` \u2192 `\"arc\" + \"acos\"` = `\"arccos\"` \u2713\n- `\"atan\"` \u2192 `\"arc\" + \"atan\"` = `\"arctan\"` \u2713\n- `\"acot\"` \u2192 `\"arc\" + \"acot\"` = `\"arccot\"` \u2713\n\nBut for `acsc` and `asec`, the \"a\" prefix needs to be removed before adding \"arc\".\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe solution needs to handle the name transformation properly:\n\n1. **Option 1 (Recommended):** Strip the leading \"a\" and prepend \"arc\":\n   ```python\n   if name in inv_trig_ta",
