      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problems:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Timing of the check**: The check `isinstance(other, MatrixRequired)` happens BEFORE `_matrixify(other)` is called. However, `_matrixify` is what converts valid matrix-like objects (lists, tuples, etc.) into Matrix instances. So the check rejects valid inputs like `Matrix @ [[1,2],[3,4]]`.\n\n2. **Wrong base class**: Checking against `MatrixRequired` is too restrictive - it's an abstract base class. We need to check if the operand is actually a scalar vs. a matrix-like object.\n\n3. **The check needs to happen AFTER `_matrixify`**: We should let `_matrixify` do its job of converting matrix-like inputs, then check if the result is actually a Matrix or if it remained a scalar.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test likely tries operations like:\n- `Matrix @ Matrix` - should work \u2713\n- `scalar @ Matrix` - should fail \u2717\n- `Matrix @ scalar` - sh",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## What Was Wrong With The Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch checks if `other` is an instance of `MatrixRequired` **after** calling `_matrixify(other)`. The `_matrixify` function converts scalars into matrices, so by the time we check `isinstance(other, MatrixRequired)`, the scalar has already been converted to a matrix, making the check useless.\n\n## Key Insight from the Code\n\nThe `_matrixify` function (likely defined elsewhere in the file) is designed to convert various inputs into matrix form. For the `@` operator to properly reject scalars, we need to check if the operand is a scalar **before** calling `_matrixify`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Check for scalar operands BEFORE calling `_matrixify`**\n   - Move the type check to happen before `_matrixify(other)` is called\n   - Check if `other` is a matrix-like object (has matrix properties) or can be a valid matrix operand\n\n2. **Proper scalar detection**\n   - ",

This is backwards - we should check what type `other` is AFTER attempting to convert it, or check the original type before conversion.\n\n3. **Incomplete validation**: The check `if not is_sequence(other)` after checking `if not isinstance(other, MatrixRequired)` is redundant and doesn't properly catch all scalar cases. A scalar could be wrapped in a sequence.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach should be:\n\n1. **Check the original type BEFORE `_matrixify`**: We need to validate that `other` is either already a matrix or can be converted to one (like a ",
