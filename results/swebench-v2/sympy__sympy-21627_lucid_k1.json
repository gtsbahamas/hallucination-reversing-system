      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to a **formatting issue** - the patch file ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. Looking at the patch content, the last line is incomplete:\n\n```diff\n             abs_free_arg = _arg.xreplace({i: Dummy(real=True)\n```\n\nThis line should continue with the rest of the statement but was cut off.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Incomplete patch**: The diff was truncated and didn't include the complete code block\n2. **Logic placement**: While the idea of checking `arg.is_extended_real` early is correct, the patch placed the check but then had an incomplete `return` statement without proper handling\n3. **Missing context**: The patch didn't show what should happen after the early return for real arguments\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nBased on the hint provided in the issue, here's what needs to be done:\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Add early return for real arguments**: Before computing `conjugate(arg)`, check if the argument is real and r",
