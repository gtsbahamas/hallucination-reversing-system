However, this doesn't solve the root cause of the issue.\n\n**The actual problem:**\n\nWhen `BlockDiagMatrix` has only one matrix element, the `blocks` property creates a 1\u00d71 `ImmutableDenseMatrix` containing that single matrix. When this gets indexed with `self.blocks[row_block, col_block]`, it returns the matrix element directly. But when there's only one element, SymPy's matrix simplification can return a scalar (like `One`) instead of keeping it as a matrix, making it non-subscriptable.\n\nThe traceback shows:\n```\nFile \"blockmatrix.py\", line 248, in _entry\n    return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]\nTypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable\n```\n\nThis happens because `self.blocks[0, 0]` returns a scalar `One` object i",
