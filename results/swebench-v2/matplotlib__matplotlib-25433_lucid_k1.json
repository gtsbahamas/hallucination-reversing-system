      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test failure, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch calls `self.canvas.release_mouse(None)` in both `clear()` and `clf()` methods\n2. The `release_mouse()` method doesn't exist on the canvas object - this is causing an `AttributeError`\n3. The test `test_grab_clear` is failing because the method doesn't exist\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n1. The problem occurs when `clf()` is called from within a RangeSlider's `on_changed` callback\n2. The slider widget is destroyed while its mouse event handling is still active\n3. This leaves the canvas in a state where it thinks a mouse grab is still active, blocking all subsequent input\n4. The same issue doesn't occur with Button's `on_clicked` callback\n\n**Root cause:**\nWhen a widget (like RangeSlider) is handling a mouse event and gets destroyed mid-callback, the canvas's internal mouse grab state isn't properly released. The canvas tracks which artist",
