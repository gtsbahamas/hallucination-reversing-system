This is problematic because:\n\n1. The code continues to use `cur_model` in subsequent iterations of the loop\n2. When processing nested relationships, `cur_model` is reassigned based on the field's related model, which could still be a proxy model\n3. The fix only addressed the immediate `opts` usage but didn't prevent proxy models from being used in later iterations\n\n**Key insight from the hint:**\nThe maintainer's suggestion was clear:\n```python\ncur_model = cur_model._meta.concrete_model\nopts = cur_model._meta\n```\n\nThis ensures that `cur_model` itself is replaced with the concrete model, so all subsequent operations use the concrete model rather than the proxy.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\nIn `django/db/models/sql/query.py` around line 742-745, we n",
