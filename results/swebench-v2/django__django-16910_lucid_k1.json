      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to a **formatting issue** - the patch file \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\". This is a syntax error in the diff format itself, not a logical error in the approach.\n\nLooking at the patch structure, the issue is likely:\n1. Missing newline at the end of the patch\n2. Incorrect indentation or line continuation\n3. Truncated content in the diff\n\n## What Was Right About the Approach\n\nThe logic was sound:\n- Check if `field in only_load` to see if specific fields were requested via `only()`\n- If yes, use those specific fields\n- If no, fall back to the default behavior (all concrete fields for base models)\n\nThis correctly addresses the regression where `only()` fields were being ignored for reverse OneToOneField relations.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe patch needs to be reformatted with proper diff syntax.
