The issue mentions that the ID is being set to something like `id3` instead of the name. Let me trace through the code more carefully.\n\nAfter reviewing the issue more carefully, the problem is in how figure numbers are being assigned. The check `node.get('title')` was added to skip nodes without titles, but this breaks the ability to reference tables by their explicit `:name:` even if they don't have a caption.\n\nHere's the correct patch:\n\n--- a/sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py\n+++ b/sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py\n@@ -282,7 +282,7 @@ class TocTree:\n                 if domain.name == 'std' and docname in env.toc_fignumbers:\n                     for figtype, fignums in env.toc_fignumbers[docname].items():\n                         for id, fignum in fignums.items():\n-                            if id in node['ids'] and node.get('title'):\n+                            if id in node['ids']:\n                                 node['number'] = fignum\n                                 continue"
