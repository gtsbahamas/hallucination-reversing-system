      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply because of **formatting issues**:\n\n1. **Line ending problem**: The patch \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\" - this suggests the diff was malformed or truncated\n2. **Both hunks failed**: Neither modification could be applied to the file\n\nLooking at what the patch was trying to do:\n- **Hunk #1**: Add `TR10i` to the `fRL1` tuple (after `TR10`)\n- **Hunk #2**: Remove the standalone `rv = TR10i(rv)` call that comes after the greedy optimization\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue is that `TRmorrie` transforms expressions in a way that prevents `TR10i` from recognizing the pattern it needs to simplify. For example:\n```python\nsin(x)*sin(2*x) + cos(x)*cos(2*x)\n# After TRmorrie becomes:\nsin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + sin(2/25)/(4*sin(1/50))\n# TR10i can no longer recognize this as cos(x - 2*x) = cos(-x)\n```\n\nThe hint suggests moving `TR10i` before `TRmorrie` in the transformation sequence.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Mo",
