      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch changed the comparison from `name` to `pieces[-1]`, but this is **incomplete**. The issue is that when we have `order_by(\"record__root_id\")`:\n- `name` = `\"record__root_id\"` (the full lookup path)\n- `pieces[-1]` = `\"root_id\"` (just the last piece)\n- `field.attname` = `\"root_id\"` (the actual database column name)\n\nThe condition `getattr(field, 'attname', None) != pieces[-1]` evaluates to `\"root_id\" != \"root_id\"` which is `False`, so it correctly **prevents** applying the default ordering.\n\nHowever, the patch only changed ONE part of the condition. The variable `name` is still used elsewhere in the same conditional block for the `name != 'pk'` check, which is correct. But more importantly, **the logic flow after this condition** still uses `name` in ways that assume it's just the field name, not the full path.\n\n## Key Insights from Test",
