      "remediation": "Looking at the issue and the failed patch, I can see the core problem:\n\n## What Was Wrong With The Previous Patch\n\nThe patch tried to always factor negative bases with rational exponents as `Pow(S.NegativeOne, e) * Pow(-self, e)`, but this creates an infinite loop or evaluation issues because:\n\n1. When `Pow(-self, e)` is evaluated, if `-self` is still negative (which shouldn't happen since we negate it), it would trigger the same code path again\n2. The `Mul` construction might not evaluate properly, leading to inconsistent behavior\n3. The patch didn't properly handle the case where the positive base itself needs factorization\n\n## The Real Issue\n\nThe inconsistency occurs in the **perfect power factorization** logic. When we have:\n- `(-1)**(4/5)`: No factorization possible, stays as `Pow(S.NegativeOne, Rational(4,5))`\n- `(-4)**(4/5)`: The code factors `4 = 2^2`, computes `2^(8/5) = 2 * 2^(3/5)`, but **loses track of the sign** from `(-1)**(4/5)`\n\nThe problem is in the section that handle",

The issue is that when SymPy factors the base (e.g., `-4 = -1 * 4 = -1 * 2\u00b2`), it can simplify `(-1)**(4/5)` differently depending on whether the positive part is a perfect power.\n\n3. **Wrong approach**: The patch tries to prevent evaluation with `evaluate=False`, but this just delays the problem rather than fixing the inconsistent branch selection.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe real issue is in how `Integer.__pow__` handles negative bases with rational exponents.
