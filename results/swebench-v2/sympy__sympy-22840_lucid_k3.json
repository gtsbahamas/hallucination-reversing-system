CSE then sees the `MatrixSymbol` objects `a` and `b` themselves as subexpressions and extracts them, creating the useless assignments like `x0 = a` and `x2 = b`.\n\n3. **Test failure**: The patch caused an error, likely because it prevented legitimate CSE operations on matrix expressions while not actually solving the core issue.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe problem is in how CSE handles `",
