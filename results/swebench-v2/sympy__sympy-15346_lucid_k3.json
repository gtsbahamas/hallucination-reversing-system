Looking at the patch, the issue is clear: the last line is missing a newline character or is incomplete.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe patch attempted to reorder `TR10i` and `TRmorrie` in the `futrig` function's transformation sequence, which is the correct approach based on the issue analysis. However, the patch file itself was malformed - it's missing proper line endings or has truncated content.\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nThe fix is straightforward - we need to properly reorder the transformations in the `futrig` function:\n\n1. **Move `TR10i` before `TRmorrie`** in the transformation list\n2. **Ensure proper formatting** with complete lines and newlines\n\nThe key insight from the issue is that:\n- `TRmorrie` transforms expressions like `cos(x)*cos(2*x)` into forms involving `sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))`\n- This transformation prevents `TR10i` from recognizing the p",

The error message states:\n```\npatch unexpectedly ends in middle of line\nHunk #1 FAILED at 1128.\n```\n\nThis is a technical issue with how the patch was generated, not with the logic of the fix itself.\n\n### The Intended Fix\n\nThe previous patch attempted to swap the order of `TR10i` and `TRmorrie` in the `futrig` function's transformation pipeline. Specifically:\n\n**Before:**\n```python\nTRmorrie,\nTR8,\nTR11, TR9,\nTR10i,\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\nTR10i,\nTRmorrie,\nTR8,\nTR11, TR9,\n```\n\nThis is the correct approach based on the issue analysis, which identified that:\n1. `TRmorrie` transforms expressions like `cos(x)*cos(2*x)` into forms involving `sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))`\n2. This transformation prevents `TR10i` from recognizing the pattern `sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y) = cos(x-y)`\n3. By running `TR10i` first, it can simplify the e",
