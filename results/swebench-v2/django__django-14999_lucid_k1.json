      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the patch had a malformed format. The issue is that the diff context was incomplete - it showed the beginning of the `alter_db_table` call but cut off mid-line.\n\nLet me analyze what went wrong and provide a proper fix:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The diff was malformed - it cut off in the middle of the `schema_editor.alter_db_table()` call\n2. The patch didn't include enough context lines to properly apply\n\n**What the fix should do:**\nThe logic is correct - we need to check if `old_model._meta.db_table == new_model._meta.db_table` and return early if they're the same. This makes the operation a no-op at the database level when a custom `db_table` is set.\n\n**Key insights:**\n- When `db_table` is explicitly set in model Meta options, renaming the model class doesn't change the actual database table name\n- The current code unconditionally tries to rename the table, alter foreign key fields, and rename M2M tables\n- If the table ",
