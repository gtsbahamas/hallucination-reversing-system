Let me analyze what went wrong and provide a proper fix.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The diff had duplicate `@@` headers trying to modify the same section twice\n2. The patch structure was malformed - it tried to apply two separate hunks to overlapping line ranges\n3. The logic flow was confused about where to handle the empty list case\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n1. `ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]))` works and produces `SELECT 0 AS \"foo\"`\n2. `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))` fails and produces `SELECT AS \"foo\"` (missing the value)\n3. The negated case needs to return `1 = 1` (always true) instead of `0 = 1` (always false)\n4. The `In` lookup raises `EmptyResultSet` for empty lists, but this doesn't handle negation properly\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe issue is that when `In` lookup has an empty RHS and is negated, it needs to produce valid SQL. Currently:\n- `pk__in=[]` \u2192 raises `EmptyResul",

This is a formatting issue, not a logic issue.\n\nHowever, looking at the logic of the attempted fix, there's also a conceptual problem:\n\n### What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Patch Format Error**: The patch file was malformed (missing newline at end)\n2. **Logic Issue**: The fix tried to handle empty `rhs` in the `as_sql` method by returning `'1 = 1', []` for negated empty lookups, but this approach has problems:\n   - It doesn't integrate well with the existing `EmptyResultSet` exception mechanism\n   - The `process_rhs` method was modified to not raise `EmptyResultSet` for empty params, which breaks the normal flow\n\n### Root Cause from Test Output\n\nThe issue description shows:\n- `ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]))` works \u2192 generates `SELECT 0 AS \"foo\"`\n- `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))` fails \u2192 generates `SELECT AS \"foo\"` (missing value)\n\nThe problem is ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch tried to handle empty `IN` lookups by returning `'1 = 1', []` for negated cases. However, this approach has a fundamental flaw: it returns a SQL string directly, but the parent `as_sql()` method expects to process the lookup further and wrap it properly in the query context.\n\n**Key insight from test output:**\nThe tests are failing because the patch interferes with the normal SQL generation flow. When `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))` is used, the issue is that the empty result handling happens too late in the compilation process, after the expression wrapper has already tried to generate SQL.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe real issue is in how `Q` objects with empty `IN` lookups are resolved:\n\n1. `Q(pk__in=[])` raises `EmptyResultSet` \u2192 gets converted to `0 = 1` (false)\n2. `~Q(pk__in=[])` should raise `EmptyResultSet` \u2192 negated to always true\n",
