      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can identify the issue:\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nThe previous patch added a `_print_sinc` method that converts `sinc(x)` to a `Piecewise` expression. However, the test failed with an error, which suggests the implementation has an issue.\n\n## Key Issues\n\n1. **Import location**: The imports are done inside the method, which is fine, but we need to ensure they're the correct imports.\n\n2. **Method naming**: The method is named `_print_sinc` but it should handle the `sinc` function class. We need to verify this matches how SymPy's function printing works.\n\n3. **Missing test context**: Without seeing the actual test failure message, the most likely issue is that the `sinc` function in SymPy might be in a different module or have a different class name than expected.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe core approach is correct - convert `sinc(x)` to `Piecewise((sin(x)/x, Ne(x, 0)), (1, True))`. However, we need to:\n\n1. **Check the actual function class name**: Sym",
