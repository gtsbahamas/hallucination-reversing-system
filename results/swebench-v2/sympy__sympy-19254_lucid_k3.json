Let me analyze what went wrong:\n\n### Issues with the Previous Patch:\n\n1. **Missing Import**: The patch tried to import `dup_l2_norm_squared` which doesn't exist in the codebase\n2. **Incorrect Formula**: The Knuth-Cohen bound formula used was `2**n * norm`, but this appears incomplete\n3. **No Leading Coefficient**: The original Mignotte bound included the leading coefficient `b = abs(dup_LC(f, K))`, which is important for the bound calculation\n4. **Test Failure**: The test `test_dup_zz_mignotte_bound` likely expects specific behavior that wasn't maintained\n\n### Key Insights from Research:\n\nThe **Knuth-Cohen bound** for a polynomial `f(x) = a_n*x^n + ... + a_1*x + a_0` is:\n```\nB = |a_n| * 2^n * ||f||_2\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `|a_n|` is the absolute value of the leading coefficient\n- `n` is the degree\n- `||f||_2` is the E",
