      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of the Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch added `__add__` and `__radd__` methods directly to the `LazyObject` class. However, the issue specifically mentions `SimpleLazyObject`, and the test results show the tests are for `SimpleLazyObjectTestCase`. \n\nMore critically, the patch broke existing functionality because:\n1. It overrode the existing behavior for `__add__` which may have been working through `__getattr__` delegation\n2. The explicit implementation conflicts with how `LazyObject` is designed to work - it should proxy all operations to the wrapped object\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\nLooking at the `LazyObject` class structure, I notice that:\n- Most operators are defined using `new_method_proxy(operator.xxx)` \n- There's already `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__ne__` defined this way\n- But `__add__` and `__radd__` are missing\n\n**The real issue:**\nThe `new_method_p",

The `new_method_proxy` function expects a callable that takes the wrapped object as the first argument, then any additional args. The lambda `lambda a, b: operator.add(b, a)` expects two arguments, but `new_method_proxy` will call it as `func(self._wrapped, *args)` where `args` is `(other,)`.\n\nSo when `other + lazy_obj` is evaluated:\n1. Python calls `lazy_obj.__radd__(other)`\n2. This becomes `inner(lazy_obj, other)` in `new_method_proxy`\n3.
