The attributes `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` are set during `do_3d_projection()` which is called during draw time\n2. The previous patch calls `PolyCollection.get_facecolor()` which may not have the correct colors yet if the scalarmappable hasn't been updated\n3. The edge case handling for `'face'` edgecolors creates a circular dependency risk\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nBased on the hint from @tac",

The `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` attributes are set during `do_3d_projection()` which is called during draw\n3.

This is a technical problem with how the patch was generated, not a logical error in the approach.\n\nHowever, looking at the logic of the previous patch, there are also **conceptual issues**:\n\n1. **Incomplete initialization**: The patch only checks `hasattr` and calls `update_scalarmappable()`, but doesn't ensure the `_facecolors3d` and `_edgecolors3d` attributes actually exist before trying to use them.\n\n2. **Missing the root cause**: The attributes `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` are never initialized in `Poly3DCollection.__init__` or `set_3d_properties`, which is why they don't exist when accessed.\n\n3. **Incomplete solution**: According to the hints in the issue, the real problem is that ScalarMappables don't set their colors until draw time.
