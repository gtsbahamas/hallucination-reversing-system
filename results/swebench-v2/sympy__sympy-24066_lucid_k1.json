      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n\n1. **Incorrect return statement syntax**: The line `return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), *(d[1] for d in fds))` has a syntax error. The `*` unpacking operator cannot be used directly in a tuple return like this.\n\n2. **Wrong approach**: The patch tries to validate that function arguments are dimensionless and then return `Dimension(1)`, but this breaks the original behavior where the function was supposed to return multiple values (factor and dimension).\n\n3. **The original code had a bug**: `return (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), *(d[1] for d in fds))` was trying to unpack dimensions but this creates an invalid tuple structure.\n\n## Key Insights from the Issue\n\nThe problem is that `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` should be recognized as having dimensionless arguments (since `second/(farad*ohm)` simplifies to a dimensionless quantity), and therefore `exp(",
