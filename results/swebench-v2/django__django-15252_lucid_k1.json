The issue is in the diff structure - there are formatting problems with the hunk headers and context lines.\n\nLooking at the patch more carefully:\n\n1. **Line 28 error**: `@@ -82,6 +90,14 @@ class MigrationRecorder:` - This hunk header is malformed. It should specify the method name, not the class name.\n\n2. **Missing context**: The patch doesn't properly show the context around the changes, making it difficult for the patch tool to locate where to apply the changes.\n\n3. **Duplicate docstring**: The patch adds a docstring to `applied_migrations` property (`\"\"\"A set of (app, name) tuples of applied migrations.\"\"\"`) but this property likely already has a docstring, causing a conflict.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe core logic of the previous patch was **correct** - it needs to check `router.allow_migrate()` before:\n- Creating the migrations table (`ensure_schema`)\n- Querying applied migrations (`applied_migrations`)\n- R",
