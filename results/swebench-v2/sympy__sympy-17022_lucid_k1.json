      "remediation": "Looking at the test results, the patch failed to apply due to a malformed patch format. The issue is with the indentation and structure of the diff.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\n1. **Patch Format Issue**: The diff shows malformed indentation. The `_print_Identity` method needs proper indentation to match the class structure.\n\n2. **Original Issue**: The code is printing `I` for `Identity(n)`, which gets interpreted as the imaginary unit `1j` instead of an identity matrix.\n\n3. **Previous Approach**: The previous patch attempted to add a `_print_Identity` method to `NumPyPrinter`, which is correct in principle, but the patch format was broken.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Add `_print_Identity` method to `NumPyPrinter` class** with proper indentation\n2. **Handle two cases**:\n   - When shape is an explicit integer: use `numpy.eye(n)`\n   - When shape is symbolic: raise `NotImplementedError` (as suggested in hints)\n\n3. **Proper placement**: The method should be added after existing p",
