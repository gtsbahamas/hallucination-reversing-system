Looking at the patch, the issue is that the multi-line return statement wasn't properly formatted for the diff.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Formatting Issue**: The patch has a line continuation that wasn't properly handled in the diff format\n2. **Logic Issue**: While the approach is correct (checking if subclass is a subclass of any class in `_subclasses`), the implementation needs proper formatting\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFrom the issue description:\n- `MyBigAutoField` extends `BigAutoField`\n- `BigAutoField` is in `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`\n- The current `__subclasscheck__` uses `issubclass(subclass, cls._subclasses)` which expects a single class or tuple, not a set\n- We need to check if `subclass` is a subclass of ANY class in the `_subclasses` set\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe logic is correct but needs proper formatting. The fix should:\n\n1. **Check each class in `_subcla",
