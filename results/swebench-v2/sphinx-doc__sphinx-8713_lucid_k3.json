The second hunk tries to modify `NumpyDocstring._parse_other_parameters_section` but uses incorrect line numbers (`@@ -1130,7 +1135,12 @@`)\n4. The line numbers don't account for the lines added by the first hunk\n\n## The Fix Plan\n\nThe patch logic is **correct** - both `GoogleDocstring` and `NumpyDocstring` classes need their `_parse_other_parameters_section` methods updated to respect the `napoleon_use_param` config setting, just like `_parse_parameters_section` does.\n\nHowever, the diff needs to be regenerated with correct line numbers. Since the first hunk adds 5 lines, the second hunk's starting line should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Correct",
