For example:\n- `sin(x*meter)` should fail (angle must be dimensionless)\n- But `exp(second/(ohm*farad))` should succeed because `second/(ohm*farad)` IS dimensionless (it simplifies to `1/Hz = 1`)\n\nThe patch correctly checked if arguments are dimensionless but then:\n1.

Raised an error for non-dimensionless args (too strict - should let the function handle it)\n\n**The real issue:**\nThe original code had a syntax error in the return statement:\n```python\nreturn (expr.func(*(f[0] for f in fds)), *(d[1] for d in fds))\n```\nThis unpacks dimensions incorrectly.
