      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the patch has a malformed format. Let me analyze the issue and provide a clean fix.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core issue is:\n1. When `BlockMatrix._blockmul()` performs block multiplication, it creates `Zero` scalar objects instead of `ZeroMatrix` objects\n2. When the result is used in a subsequent multiplication, `colblocksizes` property tries to access `.cols` on these `Zero` scalars, which don't have that attribute\n3. The `Zero` objects are created during the `.doit()` call in the multiplication logic\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Malformed diff format**: The patch had syntax errors in the diff format\n2. **Circular dependency**: Trying to fix `colblocksizes` by calling `self.rowblocksizes` and `self.colblocksizes` creates circular issues when those properties themselves have `Zero` objects\n3. **Wrong location**: The fix attempted to handle the symptom (Zero in colblocksizes) rather than the root cause (Zero being created during mu",

      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format**. The issue is with the indentation and structure of the diff - specifically around line 23 where it shows `def rowblocksizes(self):` without proper context.\n\nLooking at the patch structure, the problem is:\n1. The patch has inconsistent indentation in the diff format\n2. The context lines around `@property` and `def rowblocksizes(self):` are not properly formatted\n3. The patch appears to have mixed spaces/tabs or incorrect indentation that makes it unparseable\n\n## Root Cause of the Original Bug\n\nFrom the issue description and code analysis:\n\n1. When `b._blockmul(b)` is called, it returns a result where zero blocks are represented as `Zero` (scalar) instead of `ZeroMatrix`\n2. The `colblocksizes` property tries to access `.cols` attribute on all blocks in the first row\n3. `Zero` objects don't have a `.cols` attribute, causing `AttributeError`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Fix the `c",
