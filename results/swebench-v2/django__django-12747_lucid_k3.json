However, this approach is **incomplete** because:\n\n1. **It only addresses one deletion path** - the regular deletion in the main loop\n2. **It ignores fast deletes** - the `fast_deletes` path also contributes to the counter\n3. **The root cause is different** - The issue states that models WITHOUT foreign keys show `{'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0}` while models WITH foreign keys show `{}`. This suggests the problem is about when zero-count entries are added, not about preventing deletion operations.\n\n## Key Insights from the Issue\n\n1. **Models without foreign keys** \u2192 Result: `(0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})`\n2. **Models with foreign keys** \u2192 Result: `(0, {})`\n\nThe inconsistency happens because:\n- When a model has no related objects to casca",

      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can see the issue clearly:\n\n## What Was Wrong With The Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch had a **catastrophic syntax error** - it completely broke the code structure by:\n1. Placing a `return` statement in the middle of the function\n2. Leaving orphaned code after the return that would never execute\n3. Breaking the indentation and flow of the original logic\n\nThe patch tried to filter out zero counts but did so by inserting the return statement prematurely, before the actual deletion logic completed.\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nThe fix should be minimal and surgical - only modify the final return statement at the very end of the `delete()` method to filter out zero counts from the `deleted_counter` dictionary.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test output shows \"error=1\" which indicates the patch caused a runtime error, likely due to the malformed code structure. The tests expect:\n1. `test_fast_delete_empty_no_update_can_self_select` -",
