      "remediation": "Looking at this issue, I need to analyze what went wrong with the previous patch and why the tests failed.\n\n## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue occurs when a model has a field named `filterable` (like `ProductMetaDataType.filterable`). When this model instance is used in a filter (e.g., `metadata_type=self.brand_metadata`), Django's `check_filterable()` method incorrectly checks if the model instance has a `filterable` attribute and finds the model field instead of checking if it's an Expression with `filterable=False`.\n\n## What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch added a check for `hasattr(expression, 'resolve_expression')` to determine if something is an Expression. However, this approach has a critical flaw:\n\n**Model instances also have a `resolve_expression` method** (inherited from various Django model machinery), so the check `hasattr(expression, 'resolve_expression')` returns `True` for model instances too. This means:\n\n1. When `expression` is a `ProductMetaD",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch used `isinstance(expression, BaseExpression)` to check if the expression is a Django expression object. However, this check is **too narrow** because:\n\n1. Model instances (like `ProductMetaDataType` objects) are NOT instances of `BaseExpression`\n2. The check needs to distinguish between Django query expressions (which have `filterable` attribute) and regular Python objects (like model instances) that might coincidentally have a `filterable` attribute\n\n**The Real Problem:**\nWhen filtering with `metadata_type=self.brand_metadata`, Django passes the model instance to `check_filterable()`. If that model has a `filterable` field, `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the field's value (e.g., `False`), triggering the error incorrectly.\n\n## Key Insights from Hint\n\nThe hint suggests: `if hasattr(expression, 'resolve_expre",
