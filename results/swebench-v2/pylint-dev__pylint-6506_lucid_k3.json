The test results show an error occurred, likely because:\n1. `print_messages()` is not a valid method on the linter object\n2. The messages added via `add_message()` aren't being printed to stdout/stderr properly\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. The issue wants to suppress the traceback while still showing the error message\n2. The error message is already being added via `linter.add_message(\"unrecognized-option\", ...)`\n3. The problem is that messages aren't automatically printed - they need to be explicitly output\n4. Looking at the code flow, when `_UnrecognizedOptionError` is raised, it bubbles up and causes a traceback\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is to:\n\n1. **Print the help/usage information** - Similar to ho",

      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch attempted to fix the traceback issue by replacing the `raise _UnrecognizedOptionError` with a graceful exit. However, the tests are failing because the patch fundamentally changes the expected behavior.\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch:\n\n1. **Premature message display**: The patch calls `linter.reporter.display_messages(None)` immediately after adding the unrecognized-option message, but this happens before the normal flow completes.\n\n2. **Unconditional help display**: The patch always prints the full help text for unrecognized options, which may not be what the tests expect.\n\n3. **Breaking test expectations**: The tests `test_unknown_option_name` and `test_unknown_short_option_name` likely expect the exception to be raised (and caught elsewhere) rather than having the program exit directly at this point.\n\n### Key insights from the test output:\n\nThe test output shows \"error=1\" which indicates the test encountered an unexpected error.

This likely causes errors because the reporter may not be ready to display messages at that point in the initialization flow.\n\n2. **Wrong location for the catch**: The exception is caught in `run.py` after calling `_config_initialization()`, but the exception is raised at the END of `_config_initialization()`. This means the \"unrecognized-option\" message has already been added to the linter, but we're trying to display it before the normal flow completes.\n\n3. **Message display mechanism**: The patch assumes `display_messages(None)` will work, but this is not the standard way to display accumulated messages in pylint.\n\n### Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe tests are failing with errors (not j",
