The `ast.get_docstring()` function returns this numeric value as an integer instead of a string, causing a `TypeError` when the code tries to check if `\"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\"` is in it.\n\n**What Was Wrong With the Previous Patch:**\n\nThe previous patch added two type checks:\n1. `if isinstance(doc, str) and self.is_rewrite_disabled(doc):` in the `run()` method\n2. `return docstring is not None and \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring` in `is_rewrite_disabled()`\n\nHowever, this creates a **logic error**. When `doc` is an integer:\n- The first check `isinstance(doc, str)` returns `False`\n- So `self.is_rewrite_disabled(doc)` is **never called**\n- The function continues as if rewriting is enabled\n- But later, the integer docstring remains in the AST and causes issues\n\nThe test",

However, this doesn't solve the root problem - it just avoids the error by skipping the check when `doc` is not a string.\n\nThe real issue is that **`ast.get_docstring()` is incorrectly returning an integer** when the first expression in a file is a number literal (like `0`). According to Python's AST behavior, `ast.get_docstring()` should only return a string docstring or `None`, but it appears to be returning the actual constant value in some cases.\n\n## Key Insights from the Test Output\n\nThe test `test_constant_not_picked_as_module_docstring` is failing, which suggests the fix needs to ensure that numeric constants at the start of a file are NOT treated as docstrings at all.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the code flow:\n1.
