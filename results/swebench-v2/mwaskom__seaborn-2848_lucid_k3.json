The indentation structure is broken:\n\n```python\nexcept KeyError:\n    # If this is a categorical mapping, return transparent for unknown values\n    if self.map_type == \"categorical\":\n        value = (0, 0, 0, 0)\n    else:\n    # Use the colormap to interpolate between existing datapoints  # <-- Missing 'else:' here\n    try:\n```\n\nThis causes a Python syntax error, which explains why the test run shows \"error=1\" - the code couldn't even be parsed/executed.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix is straightforward - properly structure the conditional logic:\n\n1. **Add the missing `else:` keyword** before the colormap interpolation block\n2. **Maintain proper indentation** for the try-except block that handles numeric interpolation\n\nThe corrected structure should be:\n\n```python\nexcept ",

      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch only handled the `_lookup_single` method in `HueMapping`, returning transparent color `(0, 0, 0, 0)` for unknown categorical values. However, this doesn't address the root cause - the issue occurs earlier in the data flow when `PairGrid` tries to process hue data.\n\n**Key insight from the issue description:**\nThe problem states: \"PairGrid now lets `hue` at the grid-level delegate to the axes-level functions if they have `hue` in their signature. But it's not properly handling the case where `hue` is *not* set for the grid, but *is* specified for one mapped function.\"\n\nThe error `TypeError: ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types` suggests that when `hue_order` is a subset of hue values, the code is trying to call `isnan()` on non-numeric data (likely categorical string values that aren't in the lookup table).\n\n## Root Cause\n\nW",
