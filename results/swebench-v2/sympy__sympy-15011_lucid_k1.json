      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, I need to understand what went wrong with the previous patch. The patch attempted to fix the issue by checking if a MatrixSymbol has an invalid name and forcing dummification, but it seems there was an error during execution.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Issues\n\nThe previous patch had several problems:\n\n1. **Incorrect function signature**: The recursive call to `_preprocess` was modified to include `dummify=dummify`, but the function signature doesn't accept `dummify` as a parameter - it's a closure variable.\n\n2. **Logic error**: The patch tried to detect invalid MatrixSymbol names upfront with `has_invalid_matrix_symbol`, but then didn't properly use this information in the dummification logic.\n\n3. **Incomplete fix**: The patch modified the condition but didn't ensure that the dummification actually happens for MatrixSymbols with invalid names.\n\n## Key Insights from Code Analysis\n\nLooking at the `_preprocess` function more carefully:\n\n1.
