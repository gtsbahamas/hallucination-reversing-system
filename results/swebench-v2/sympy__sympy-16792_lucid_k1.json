      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, the previous patch had malformed diff syntax - it had duplicate/conflicting lines. Let me analyze what went wrong and create a proper fix.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch was malformed because it:\n1. Had duplicate `else: raise ValueError(\"Unknown Routine argument: %s\" % arg)` blocks\n2. Tried to add tracking code in the middle of an if-elif-else chain incorrectly\n3. The logic was confused about where to track array dimensions\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe real issue is in the `make_routine` function (around line 1036 based on the attempted patch). When creating `InputArgument` objects, the code only checks if a symbol is in `array_symbols` (which are symbols that appear in expressions as arrays). However, if a `MatrixSymbol` is passed as an argument but doesn't appear in the expression, it won't be in `array_symbols`, so its dimensions won't be set.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix should be in `make_routine` where `InputArgument` objects are created.
