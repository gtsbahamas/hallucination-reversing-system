The issue is in the patch structure:\n\n```diff\n-            yield self.choice(obj)\n+            if obj.pk not in seen_pks:\n+                seen_pks.add(obj.pk)\n+                yield self.choice(obj)\n```\n\nThe problem is that the original line `yield self.choice(obj)` needs proper context lines around it in the diff. The patch is missing the proper indentation context and the loop structure that contains this yield statement.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **The approach is correct**: Deduplicating by tracking seen PKs is the right solution, as mentioned in the issue comments - filtering duplicates in Python rather than using `.distinct()` which caused problems with custom fields.\n\n2. **The location is correct**: The `ModelChoiceIterator.__iter__()` method is where choices are generated for form fields.\n\n3. **The logic is sound**: \n   - Track seen PKs in a set\n   - Only yield choices for objects w",

The patch file itself is malformed - missing final newline character\n2. The logic is sound but the formatting broke the patch application\n\n**What the patch was trying to do (correctly):**\n- Add deduplication logic in `ModelChoiceIterator.__iter__()` \n- Track seen primary keys in a set\n- Only yield choices for objects not yet seen\n- This prevents duplicate options when `limit_choices_to` uses joins\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe solution is straightforward - **ensure proper patch formatting**:\n\n1. **Keep the exact same logic** (it's correct):\n   - Initialize `seen_pks = set()` before the loop\n   - Check `if obj.pk not in seen_pks:` before yielding\n   - Add pk to set and yield the choice\n\n2. **Fix the formatting issue**:\n   - Ensure the patch ends with a proper ne",

Line 18 of the patch shows: `-        return len(self.queryset)` \n2. This line is missing its corresponding `+` line (the replacement)\n3. The patch tool expects paired `-` and `+` lines or standalone additions/deletions\n\nLooking at the intended change:\n```python\ndef __len__(self):\n-        return len(self.queryset)\n+        # Ensure we get an accurate count by deduplicating\n+        return len({obj.pk for obj in self.queryset})\n```\n\nThe patch should have **one deletion line** followed by **two addition lines**, but the formatting was corrupted.\n\n### Key Insights from the Issue\n\n1. **Root Cause**: When `limit_choices_to` uses a Q object with joins, the queryset can return duplicate objects (same object multiple times)\n2. **Previous Failed Solution**: Using `.distinct()` on the queryset broke with certain custom fields (like PostgreSQL's native point type) that",
