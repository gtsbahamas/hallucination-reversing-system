      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe patch correctly moved `formatter_class=DjangoHelpFormatter` from a direct parameter to a `setdefault` in kwargs. However, the test failure indicates an error occurred during evaluation, suggesting the patch may have introduced a subtle issue with how kwargs are handled.\n\nThe problem is likely that `kwargs` might already contain a `formatter_class` key in some cases, and the way the patch handles this could cause issues. More critically, looking at the code structure, the patch is correct in principle but may have ordering issues with how `**kwargs` unpacks.\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\n\nThe test shows \"error=1\" which means the patch caused a runtime error rather than just a test assertion failure. This suggests the issue is with the implementation mechanics rather than the logic.\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\nThe issue is that when ",
