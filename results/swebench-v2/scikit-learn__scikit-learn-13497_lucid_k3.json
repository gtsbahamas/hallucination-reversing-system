This still performs the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` when `discrete_features` is a list (which is array-like but not an ndarray)\n2. Lists can be passed as discrete features (array of indices), and comparing a list to 'auto' will work but is unnecessary\n3. The logic is inverted - we should check if it IS a string first, not if it's NOT other types\n\n## The Core Issue\n\nThe problem is that `discrete_features` can be:\n- The string `'auto'` (default)\n- A boolean (`True` or `False`)\n- An array-like (list, numpy array, etc.) of indices or boolean mask\n\nWhen it's an array, the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` triggers a FutureWarning in numpy because it tries to do element-wise comparison.\n\n## Fix Plan",
