      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\nThe previous patch removed the `v_imports` calculation but still included it in the imports set:\n```python\nv_string, v_imports = serializer_factory(self.value.value).serialize()\nimports = {'import %s' % module, *v_imports}\nreturn \"%s.%s[%r]\" % (module, enum_class.__name__, self.value.name), imports\n```\n\nThe issue is that `v_string` is no longer used (which is correct), but `v_imports` is still being unpacked into the imports set. Since we're now using bracket notation `EnumClass['NAME']` instead of calling the enum with its value `EnumClass(value)`, we don't need to serialize the enum's value anymore, and therefore don't need its imports either.\n\n**Key insight from the approach:**\nWhen using `EnumClass['NAME']` syntax, we only need:\n1. The enum class itself (via its module import)\n2. The name as a string literal (no additional imports needed)\n\n",
