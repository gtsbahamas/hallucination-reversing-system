Looking at the patch structure, the `__rmul__` method was added but the patch didn't properly close/complete.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\n1. **Patch format error**: The diff ended abruptly without properly completing the context lines after the new `__rmul__` method\n2. **Missing context**: The patch needs to show enough context lines after the added method so the patch tool knows where to place it correctly\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe `__rmul__` implementation itself is correct - it mirrors `__mul__` but with reversed operand order. The issue is purely in the patch format. We need to:\n\n1. **Add the `__rmul__` method** right after `__mul__` (same location as before)\n2. **Include proper context lines** after the method to ensure the patch applies cleanly\n3. **Ensure the patch is complete** with no truncated lines\n\nThe implementation should be:\n```python\ndef __rmul_",

This is a formatting issue with the diff, not a logical problem with the code.\n\nLooking at the patch content, the implementation itself is correct:\n- It adds `__rmul__` method to handle reverse multiplication (when a scalar is on the left: `2.0 * point`)\n- The logic mirrors `__mul__` but with `factor*x` instead of `x*factor`\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe patch file was malformed - it appears to have been truncated or improperly formatted, causing the patch application to fail before the code could even be tested.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe solution is straightforward - we need to provide a properly formatted patch with the same logic:\n\n1. **Add the `__rmul__` method** right after the `__mul__` method in the Point class\n2. **Implementation**: Use `sympify(factor)` and multiply each coordinate by the factor\n3. **Return**: A new Point with the scaled coordinates, with `eva",
