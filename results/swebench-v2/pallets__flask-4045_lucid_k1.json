      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe patch used `assert` to validate the blueprint name, but `assert` statements can be disabled when Python runs with optimization flags (`-O` or `-OO`). This makes the validation unreliable in production environments.\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\nThe tests are failing with an error (not just assertion failures), which suggests the validation isn't working as expected. The test names indicate:\n1. `test_dotted_name_not_allowed` - expects an error when blueprint name contains dots\n2. `test_route_decorator_custom_endpoint_with_dots` - likely tests that endpoint dots are still caught\n\n**What needs to change:**\nReplace the `assert` statement with a proper exception that will always be raised, regardless of Python optimization settings. This should be a `ValueError` (standard for invalid argument values) and should provide a clear error mess",
