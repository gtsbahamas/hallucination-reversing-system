While this prevents the numpy comparison warning, **it's incomplete** because it doesn't handle the case when `discrete_features` is already an array or boolean mask that gets passed in.\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nThe issue states: \"discrete features can be an array of indices or a boolean mask. This will error in future versions of numpy.\"\n\nLooking at the code flow:\n1. Line 235: `if discrete_features == 'auto':` - This is the problematic comparison\n2. If `discrete_features` is an array, comparing it to `'auto'` triggers a numpy FutureWarning\n3. The previous patch only checks if it's a string first, but this doesn't fully solve the logic\n\n## What the Test Expects\n\nThe test `test_mutual_info_options` likely tests the function with:\n- `discrete_features='auto'` \n- `discrete_featur",
