However, **`_coeff_isneg` is designed for scalar expressions, not matrix expressions**. \n\nThe key issue is that `MatAdd` contains matrix terms like `MatrixSymbol('y*', n, n)` or `-MatrixSymbol('x', n, n)`, and these don't have the same structure as scalar `Add` terms. When you call `_coeff_isneg()` on a matrix expression, it likely doesn't work correctly because:\n\n1. Matrix expressions don't decompose the same way as scalar expressions\n2. A term like `-MatrixSymbol('x', n, n)` is actually `Mul(-1, MatrixSymbol('x', n, n))`, not a simple coefficient\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nThe original buggy code tried to use `S(item.args[0]).is_negative` which:\n- Assumed `item.args[0]` would be a string representation\n- Used `sympify` on it, which failed fo",

This fails when matrix names contain special characters like `*` (as in `'y*'`).\n\n3. **Wrong approach**: The patch tries to detect negative coefficients by examining the structure, but doesn't use the existing SymPy utility `_coeff_isneg` which is already imported and used in `_print_Add`.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test shows an error occurred, meaning the patch didn't properly ",
