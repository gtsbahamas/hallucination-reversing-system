      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply because of a formatting issue - the patch file \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\", indicating the diff wasn't properly formatted (likely missing a newline at the end).\n\nLooking at the issue and the patch:\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch file itself had formatting issues (missing final newline)\n2. The line numbers in the hunks (1512 and 1557) may not match the actual file\n\n**What the fix should do:**\nThe issue correctly identifies that the error message says `ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\")` when it should say `ManyToManyField(\"%s\", through=\"%s\")` because:\n- `symmetrical` and `through` are ManyToManyField arguments, not ForeignKey arguments\n- The `symmetrical=False` requirement was removed in Django 3.0 for recursive relationships\n\n**Key insights:**\n1. There are TWO locations in the file where this hint appears (around lines 1512 and 1557 based on the patch)\n2. Both need to be fixed\n3. The hint should use `ManyToMany",

      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply due to a **malformed patch format**. The issue is with the indentation and structure of the diff - specifically around line 17 where it tries to continue the hint parameter.\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch:\n\n1. **Indentation inconsistency**: The patch mixed indentation levels incorrectly when trying to modify the multi-line hint string\n2. **Malformed continuation**: The closing parenthesis and continuation of the `relationship_model_name` parameter were not properly formatted in the diff\n\n### What the patch was trying to fix (correctly):\n\nThe patch correctly identified that:\n1. `ForeignKey` should be changed to `ManyToManyField` (since these are M2M field hints)\n2. `symmetrical=False` should be removed (outdated since Django 3.0)\n3. This needs to be fixed in TWO locations (errors E335 and E336)\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe patch needs to be reformatted with proper indentation. The key changes are:\n\n1. **Line ~1515**: Change `'use Foreign",

      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply because of a formatting issue - the patch file \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\". This is a technical issue with how the patch was formatted, not with the logic of the fix itself.\n\nLooking at the patch content, the fix is conceptually correct:\n- It changes `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField` in the hint messages\n- It removes the outdated `symmetrical=False` parameter (which was deprecated in Django 3.0)\n\nHowever, the patch has formatting problems that prevent it from being applied.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Locate the exact lines** in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` where the error hints are generated (around lines 1512-1520 and 1557-1565 based on the patch context)\n\n2. **Update both hint messages** to:\n   - Change `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField` \n   - Remove the `symmetrical=False` parameter entirely\n   - Keep the `through` parameter\n\n3. **Ensure proper formatting** - the hint should read:\n   ```python\n   'use ManyTo",
