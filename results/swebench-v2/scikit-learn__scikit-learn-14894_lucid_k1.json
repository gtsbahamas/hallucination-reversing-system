When there are no support vectors, `dual_coef_data` is an empty array, but the patch still tried to use it in the sparse matrix construction in the else branch.\n\nMore critically, the test shows an **error** rather than a pass/fail, suggesting the patch may have introduced a syntax issue or the logic doesn't properly handle all edge cases.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\n1. The test `test_sparse_fit_support_vectors_empty` resulted in an **error** (not just a failure)\n2. This indicates the code likely crashes or has a runtime issue\n3. The original issue shows that when `n_SV = 0`, the division `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` causes `ZeroDivisionError`\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the ori",
