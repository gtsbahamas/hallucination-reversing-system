      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed to apply because it has a formatting issue - the patch file \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\". Looking at the patch, the issue is that the line ending is incomplete or malformed.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe patch itself has the right logic (changing `is None` to `in field.empty_values`), but the diff format is broken. The patch needs proper line endings and context.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe fix needs to:\n\n1. **Apply the same logical change** - Replace the `is None` check with `in field.empty_values` check in the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save()` method\n2. **Ensure proper patch formatting** - Include complete lines with proper context\n\nThe key insight from the issue is:\n- When a `Product` with a CharField primary key is created without the `sku` set initially, then the `sku` is set later, the `Order.product_id` field retains an empty string `\"\"` instead of being updated to the actual `sku` value\n- The current code only checks `if getattr(self, field.at",
