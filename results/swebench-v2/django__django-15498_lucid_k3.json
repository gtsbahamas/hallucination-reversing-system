However, this is the **opposite** of what's needed. The issue states that empty strings \"used to be ignored\" - meaning they should return `True` (indicating the resource was modified), not raise an exception.\n\n**The actual problem:**\nWhen `header` is an empty string `\"\"`, the regex match `re.match(r\"^([^;]+)(; length=([0-9]+))?$\", header, re.IGNORECASE)` returns `None` (no match), which causes `matches[1]` to raise an `AttributeError` when trying to access index on `None`. This `AttributeError` is caught and returns `True`, which is the correct behavior.\n\nHowever, after commit d6aff369ad3, something changed that now causes an exception to be raised instead of being caught. Looking at the code, the issue is that `parse_http_date(matches[1])` i",
