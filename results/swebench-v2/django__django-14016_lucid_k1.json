      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format** - it was truncated and ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. The patch file itself was incomplete, not the logic.\n\nHowever, looking at the intended changes, there's also a **logical issue**: The `_clone()` method uses shallow copy (`self.children[:]`) which won't solve the pickling problem. When `dict_keys` objects are in the children list, a shallow copy still references the same non-pickleable objects.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe issue occurs in the `_combine()` method when it calls `copy.deepcopy()` on Q objects containing non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`. The regression was introduced in commit bb0b6e526340e638522e093765e534df4e4393d2 which likely changed how Q objects are combined.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Key Insight**: We don't actually need to deep copy the Q objects at all. When combining Q objects with `|` or `&`, we're creating a new Q object that contains the original Q objects ",
