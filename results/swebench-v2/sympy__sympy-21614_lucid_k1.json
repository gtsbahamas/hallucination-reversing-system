Let me search for it in the repository structure. Since the file is truncated, I'll need to make an educated guess based on typical SymPy patterns.\n\nThe `Derivative` class should have an `expr` property that returns the expression being differentiated (typically `self.args[0]`). The `kind` property should simply return `self.expr.kind`.\n\nHere's the complete patch:\n\n<budget:token_budget>199500</budget:token_budget>\n\n--- a/sympy/core/function.py\n+++ b/sympy/core/function.py\n@@ -1394,6 +1394,14 @@ class Derivative(Expr):\n     def expr(self):\n         return self.args[0]\n \n+    @property\n+    def kind(self):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        The kind of the derivative is the same as the kind of the expression\n+        being differentiated.\n+        \"\"\"\n+        return self.expr.kind\n+\n     @property\n     def _diff_wrt(self):\n         \"\"\"An expression may be differentiated wrt a Derivative if"
