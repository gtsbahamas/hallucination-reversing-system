This is a formatting issue, not a logical problem with the fix approach.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe patch itself had the right idea but was malformed:\n1. The patch file was truncated or improperly formatted\n2. Line 23 of the patch ended unexpectedly, causing the patch tool to fail\n3. The actual logic of the fix was correct - it needed to merge `get_form_kwargs(None)` first, then override specific keys\n\n## The Core Issue\n\nWhen `form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted': True}` is passed to the formset, the `empty_form` property tries to:\n1. Call `self.form(empty_permitted=True, **self.get_form_kwargs(None), ...)`\n2. But `get_form_kwargs(None)` returns `{'empty_permitted': True}` (from the copy)\n3. This results in `empty_permitted` being passed twice, causing: `TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument 'empty_permitted'`\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe solution",

This is a formatting issue with the patch itself, not a logical problem with the fix.\n\nLooking at the patch structure, the issue is clear: the patch is missing proper line continuation or has incorrect formatting at the end. The patch appears to be cut off or improperly formatted.\n\n## What Was Wrong\n\nThe patch content is actually **correct in logic** - it follows the exact approach suggested in the hints:\n1. Build a `form_kwargs` dict first\n2. Spread `self.get_form_kwargs(None)` first (so it can be overridden)\n3. Override specific keys like `empty_permitted`, `auto_id`, etc.\n4. Pass the merged dict to `self.form()`\n\nHowever, the **patch format itself is broken** - likely missing a newline at the end or has whitespace issues.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe solution is to **regenerate the exact same logical change but with proper patch formatting**:\n\n1",
