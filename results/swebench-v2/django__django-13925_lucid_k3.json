The issue is that the return statement at the end is incomplete.\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch is malformed - it ends with `return [` without completing the statement\n2. The logic has a critical flaw: it returns an empty list `[]` when it finds a parent with an explicit PK, but then falls through to a `return [` that would create the warning - this is backwards\n\n**What the code should do:**\nThe warning (models.W042) should NOT be raised when:\n- A model inherits from a parent that has an explicitly defined (non-auto-created) primary key\n- The child model doesn't define its own primary key (so it inherits the parent's)\n\n**Key insight from the issue:**\nModels like `User(Entity)` where `Entity` has `id = SmallUDIDField(primary_key=True)` should NOT trigger the warning because they inherit an explicitly defined PK from their parent.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe logic should b",
