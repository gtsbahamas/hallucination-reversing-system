      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed diff format**. The issue is in how the conditional logic was restructured - the diff shows incorrect indentation and flow control that doesn't properly represent the changes.\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch:\n\n1. **Malformed diff syntax**: The patch has incorrect line markers and indentation that makes it unparseable\n2. **Logic flow issue**: The restructured if-else chain doesn't cleanly apply as a patch\n3. **The `else:` statement**: The diff shows `else:` followed by `return [E004]` which creates parsing confusion\n\n### What the fix should do:\n\nAccording to the issue and Django's documented behavior:\n- When `LANGUAGE_CODE` is set to a sublanguage (e.g., `de-at`)\n- And the base language exists in `LANGUAGES` (e.g., `de`)\n- Django should **not** raise `translation.E004`\n\nThe current code only checks for exact matches in `available_tags`, but needs to also check if the base language (the part before the hyphen) is avai",
