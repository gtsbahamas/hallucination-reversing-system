      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test results, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Problems with the Previous Patch\n\n1. **Logic Error in Exception Handling**: The patch tries to check `len(seq)` inside the `try` block, but when a `TypeError` is raised (for unhashable items), the code jumps to the `except` block. At that point, the variable `s` from the last iteration is used, but this `s` might already be in `seen` (just unhashable), leading to incorrect behavior.\n\n2. **Incorrect Exception Handling Flow**: When a `TypeError` occurs (unhashable element), the code should handle that specific element and continue with the rest of the sequence. However, the current patch's `except` block tries to recursively call `uniq(seq, result)`, which would re-iterate the entire sequence from the beginning, duplicating already-yielded elements.\n\n3. **The `check_len` placement**: The length check happens inside the loop after an element is retrieved, but the exception handling doesn't account for the s",
