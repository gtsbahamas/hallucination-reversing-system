      "remediation": "## Analysis\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch\n\nThe previous patch removed the `\\b` (word boundary) anchor from the regex pattern. While this allows matching punctuation-only tags like `???`, it creates a **critical problem**: it now matches partial words and creates false positives.\n\nFor example, with the pattern `#\\s*(TODO)` (without `\\b`):\n- `# TODO: fix this` \u2713 (correct match)\n- `# TODONE: already done` \u2717 (false positive - matches \"TODO\" in \"TODONE\")\n- `# MYTODO: my task` \u2717 (false positive - matches \"TODO\" in \"MYTODO\")\n\nThe `\\b` word boundary was there for a good reason - to ensure we only match complete words, not substrings within larger words.\n\n### The Real Problem\n\nThe issue is that `\\b` is a **word boundary** that matches between a word character (`\\w` = alphanumeric + underscore) and a non-word character. When a tag is entirely punctuation (like `???`), there are no word characters, so `\\b` cannot match properly:\n\n- `# ???: no` - The `???` is surrounded by spaces (no",

      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure and the previous patch, I can identify the issues:\n\n## Problems with Previous Patch\n\n1. **Removed word boundary from `notes_rgx` path**: The patch removed `\\b` from the regex when `notes_rgx` is present, which could cause false positives by matching partial words in user-provided regex patterns.\n\n2. **Incomplete word boundary logic**: The patch only adds `\\b` after notes with word characters, but doesn't consider what comes BEFORE the note. A word boundary should be at the START of the pattern to prevent matching notes that are part of longer words.\n\n3. **Pattern construction issue**: The conditional word boundary is applied per-note but then all notes are joined with `|`, which can create incorrect regex patterns when mixed.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\n1. **Add word boundary at the START of each note pattern** - Use `\\b` before the note if it starts with a word character (to prevent matching as part of a longer word like \"NOTODO\")\n\n2. **Add word",

The logic should be: only add `\\b` when the note contains word characters at the boundary.\n\n## Key Insights from Test\n\nThe test `test_non_alphanumeric_codetag` likely tests punctuation-only tags like `???`.
