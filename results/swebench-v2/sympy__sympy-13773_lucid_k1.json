      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure, I can see the issue with the previous patch. Let me analyze what went wrong:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\n**What was wrong:**\n1. The patch only checks if `other` is a `MatrixBase` instance, but it doesn't handle the case where `other` might be a list/tuple that should be converted to a matrix first\n2. The helper function `_matrixify` was defined but never actually used in the patched `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__` methods\n3. The check happens too early - before attempting to convert sequences to matrices, which is valid behavior for matrix multiplication\n\n**Key insights from the issue:**\n- `@` should work for matrix-matrix multiplication (including when one operand is a list/tuple that can be converted to a matrix)\n- `@` should **fail** for scalar-matrix multiplication (like `2 @ Matrix(...)`)\n- Regular `*` should continue to work for scalar multiplication\n\n**The fix plan:**\n\n1. **First attempt to convert `other` to a matrix** if it's a valid seq",
