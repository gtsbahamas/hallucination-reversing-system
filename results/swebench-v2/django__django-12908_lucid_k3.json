The issue is that when you call `_chain()`, it creates a new QuerySet instance, and we need to check if the CURRENT queryset (before chaining) has a combinator set.\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\nLooking at the `distinct()` method structure:\n```python\ndef distinct(self, *field_names):\n    assert not self.query.is_sliced, \\\n        \"Cannot create distinct fields once a slice has been taken.\"\n    obj = self._chain()\n    # Previous patch checked here - TOO LATE\n    obj.query.add_distinct_fields(*field_names)\n    return obj\n```\n\nThe check should happen on `self.query.combinator`, not `obj.query.combinator`, because we need to validate the operation is allowed on the current queryset state before creating the chain.\n\n**Why ",

The test results show an error occurred, likely because `NotSupportedError` wasn't properly imported or used.\n\n**Key insights from the context:**\n\n1. The file already imports `NotSupportedError` from `django.db` at the top (line 9 in the imports)\n2. The test names suggest we need to handle this properly:\n   - `test_unsupported_operations_on_combined_qs` - expects certain operations to raise errors\n   - `test_unsupported_ordering_slicing_raises_db_error` - shows the pattern for error handling\n\n3.
