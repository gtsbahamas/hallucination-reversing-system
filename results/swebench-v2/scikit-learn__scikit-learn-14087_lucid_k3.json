However, **the patch was applied in the wrong code block** - it was placed inside the `if not self.refit:` block, but the actual error occurs when `refit=False` is set.\n\nLooking at the test error and the code structure, the issue is that when `refit=False`:\n1. The code skips the normal refitting logic\n2. It tries to compute averaged coefficients from the cross-validation paths\n3. The indexing assumes 4D arrays (`coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]`) but gets 3D arrays in binary classification\n\n### Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test is specifically for `test_LogisticRegressionCV_no_refit` with different `multi_class` settings (ovr, multinomial, auto). The error occurs because:\n\n1. **Binary classification with `refit=False`**: `coefs_paths` has shape `(n_folds,",
