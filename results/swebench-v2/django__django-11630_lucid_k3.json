The diff format is malformed - the lines are not properly structured for a unified diff\n2. The indentation changes are not correctly represented\n3. Line continuations are broken, causing the patch parser to fail at line 41\n\n**What the patch was trying to do (correctly):**\n- Import `settings` and `Warning` \n- Check if `DATABASE_ROUTERS` is configured\n- If routers exist, downgrade the Error to a Warning (models.W035)\n- If no routers, keep the existing Error (models.E028)\n\n## Fix Plan\n\nThe logic is correct, but the diff needs to be properly formatted. Here's what needs to happen:\n\n1. **Proper imports**: Add `from django.conf import settings` and include `Warning` in the checks import\n2. **Conditional check logic**: Replace the single Error",
