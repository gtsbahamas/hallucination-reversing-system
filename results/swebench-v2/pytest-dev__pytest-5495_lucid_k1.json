      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\n\nThe previous patch correctly identified that bytes should be handled by `_diff_text()` instead of `_compare_eq_sequence()`, but it only partially solved the problem. The issue is that bytes objects are BOTH:\n1. Text-like (should use `_diff_text` for nice diffs)\n2. Sequences (inherit from `Sequence`)\n\nThe previous patch made bytes use `_diff_text()`, but then the code STILL falls through to the sequence comparison logic because of this block:\n\n```python\nif isiterable(left) and isiterable(right):\n    expl = _compare_eq_iterable(left, right, verbose)\n    if explanation is not None:\n        explanation.extend(expl)  # This adds the confusing \"first extra item: 52\" message\n    else:\n        explanation = expl\n```\n\nSince bytes are iterable, this code runs AFTER `_diff_text()` and appends the confusing sequence comparison messages about \"first extra it",
