The patch was placed:\n1. **Before the module docstring** - Python files should start with docstrings\n2. **Before imports** - Methods can't exist outside a class\n3. **Outside the LatexPrinter class** - The method needs to be inside the class\n\nThe patch also showed the method definition appearing twice in the diff, which suggests confusion about where to place it.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Find the existing `_print_SeqFormula` method** in the `LatexPrinter` class (it must al",
