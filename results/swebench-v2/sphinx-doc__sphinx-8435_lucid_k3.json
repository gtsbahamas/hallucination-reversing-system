This indicates:\n\n1. **Line number mismatches**: The patch was targeting incorrect line numbers\n2. **Incomplete patch format**: The patch \"unexpectedly ends in middle of line\"\n3. **Context mismatch**: The surrounding code context didn't match what was expected\n\n## Root Cause\n\nLooking at the issue and the code structure:\n\n1. **`DataDocumenter`** (for module-level variables) and **`AttributeDocumenter`** (for class attributes) both use `stringify_typehint()` to format type annotations\n2. They should be using **`restify()`** instead, which accepts `type_aliases` parameter\n3. The current code at lines ~1886 and ~2202 calls `stringify_typehint()` without passing type aliases\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. In `DataDocumenter.add_directive_header()` (around line 1886-1889):\n   - Replace `stringify_typehint(annotations.get(self.objpath[-1",

This is a technical issue with how the patch was generated, not a logical problem with the approach.\n\nHowever, looking at the patch content itself, there's also a **logical issue**:\n\n### What was wrong with the previous patch:\n\n1. **Wrong function used**: The patch calls `restify()` with `autodoc_type_aliases` as a parameter, but `restify()` doesn't accept a type aliases parameter in its signature. \n\n2. **Incorrect approach**: The code is trying to apply type aliases AFTER getting type hints, but `get_type_hints()` already accepts `localns` parameter where type aliases should be passed. The type aliases are already being passed to `get_type_hints()`, so the annotations should already be resolved.\n\n3. **The real problem**: The issue is that `stringify_typehint()` is being used instead of a function that respects `autodoc_type_aliases`.
