The `__len__` method was inserted in the wrong location with incorrect context. The patch shows:\n\n1. The `__getitem__` method's docstring and implementation appearing twice\n2. The `__len__` method being added with the wrong surrounding context\n3. The diff structure is malformed - it shows `__getitem__` content where it should just show the insertion point\n\n## What Needs to Change\n\nThe fix is simple - we just need to add a `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class that returns the length of the `steps` list. The method should be placed after `__getitem__` and before the `@property` decorators.\n\n## Correct Implementation\n\n```python\ndef __len__(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the length of the Pipeline\n    \"\"\"\n    return len(self.steps)\n```\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test output shows \"error=1\" which indicates the ",

However, the test failure indicates an error occurred during execution, not a logic error in the `__len__` implementation itself.\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\nThe test output shows:\n- \"Instances with errors: 1\"\n- \"Instances completed: 0\"\n- The test `test_make_pipeline_memory` was supposed to run but failed with an error\n\nThe error is likely not in the `__len__` implementation but in how the test environment is set up or in some interaction with other parts of the code.\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\nLooking at the original issue more carefully:\n1. The issue states: \"With the new indexing support `pipe[:len(pipe)]` raises an error\"\n2. The example code just calls `len(pipe)` which should work with the patch\n3.
