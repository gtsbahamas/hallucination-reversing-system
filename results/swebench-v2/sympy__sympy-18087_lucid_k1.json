      "remediation": "## Analysis of Previous Patch Failure\n\nThe previous patch failed due to a **malformed patch format** - it ended unexpectedly in the middle of a line. This is a formatting issue, not a logic issue.\n\nHowever, looking at the logic of the attempted fix, there are also conceptual problems:\n\n### Issues with the Previous Approach:\n\n1. **Incomplete solution**: The patch only addressed the `as_expr()` method but didn't prevent the problematic factorization from happening in the first place during `Factors.__init__()`.\n\n2. **Over-complicated conditions**: The special case handling for `sqrt` of squared negative numbers is too narrow and doesn't address the root cause.\n\n3. **Wrong location**: The real problem occurs earlier when `Factors` is constructed from `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`, which gets stored as `{sin(x)**2: 1/2}`. The `as_expr()` method then incorrectly reconstructs this as `sin(x)`.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe bug is in the `Factors.__init__()` method around lines 449-458. When processing a `Pow` obj",
