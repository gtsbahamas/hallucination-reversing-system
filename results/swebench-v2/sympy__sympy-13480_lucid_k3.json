However, the patch shows it was applied incorrectly - it added the line but didn't properly handle the indentation or the complete context. The test results show \"Instances with errors: 1\", indicating the patch caused a syntax or runtime error.\n\nLooking at the diff more carefully:\n```python\n-                    if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:\n+                    cothm = coth(m)\n+                    if cothm is S.ComplexInfinity:\n```\n\nThis appears correct, but the issue is that the patch is incomplete.

However, the test results show the patch caused an error during evaluation, which suggests the fix introduced an infinite recursion or evaluation issue.\n\n**The core problem:**\nWhen `coth(m)` is evaluated inside the `coth.eval()` method itself, it creates a recursive call. If `m` is a value that triggers the same code path (like `I*pi/2`), this leads to infinite recursion or an evaluation error.\n\n## Key Insights from Test Output\n\nThe test results show:\n- 1 instance with errors\n- 0 instances resolved\n- The error occurred during evaluation, not a syntax error\n\nThis confirms that calling `coth(m)` directly within `coth.eval()` is problematic.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Don't call `coth(m)` recursively** - Instead, evaluate what `c",

The computation `cothm = -S.ImaginaryUnit * cot(m / S.ImaginaryUnit)` was added right before the check `if cothm is S.ComplexInfinity:`, but this doesn't match the pattern used in the `tanh` function.\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\nLooking at the `tanh` function (lines 487-493), we can see the correct pattern:\n```python\nif arg.is_Add:\n    x, m = _peeloff_ipi(arg)\n    if m:\n        tanhm = tanh(m)\n        if tanhm is S.ComplexInfinity:\n            return coth(x)\n        else: # tanhm == 0\n            return tanh(x)\n```\n\nThe `tanh` function simply calls `tanh(m)` recursively to evaluate `tanhm`. The `coth` function should follow the same pattern.\n\n**Why the test failed:**\nThe patch likely introduced an error because:\n1. It's computing `cothm` using `cot` (cotangent) ",
