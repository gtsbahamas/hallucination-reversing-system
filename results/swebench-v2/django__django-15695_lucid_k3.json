When going backward with an unnamed index, it renames to the auto-generated name, but when going forward again, `self.old_name` still points to the original (now incorrect) name.\n\n3. **The test failure**: The test does:\n   - Forward: unnamed \u2192 \"new_pony_test_idx\" \u2713\n   - Backward: \"new_pony_test_idx\" \u2192 auto-generated name \u2713\n   - Forward again: tries to rename from old_name (which is still the auto-generated name from initial state) \u2192 ",

The patch attempted to restore the auto-generated index name during `database_backwards()`, but it used the **wrong state** to get the model and columns\n2. It used `from_state` (which has the NEW index name) instead of `to_state` (which has the OLD fields configuration)\n3.
