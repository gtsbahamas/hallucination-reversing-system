      "remediation": "Looking at the previous patch and test failure, I can identify the key issues:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch Problems\n\n1. **Indentation Error**: The patch has severe indentation problems. The `elif self.map_type == \"numeric\":` block and subsequent code is incorrectly indented, which would cause a syntax error.\n\n2. **Logic Flow Issue**: The original code structure had a `try-except` block that handled the `KeyError` from the lookup table, then within the except block, it tried to use the colormap for numeric interpolation. The patch attempted to add categorical handling but broke the control flow.\n\n3. **Missing Context**: The patch doesn't account for when `self.map_type` might not be set (e.g., when all data is NA), which could cause an `AttributeError`.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen `hue_order` excludes some values from the data:\n- Those excluded values are not in `self.lookup_table`\n- When `_lookup_single()` is called with an excluded key, it raises `KeyError`\n- The original code then tries ",
