      "remediation": "Looking at the test failure and the previous patch attempt, I can see the issue:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch tried to filter constraints by adding `index=True, unique=False` parameters to `_constraint_names()`. However, this approach has a fundamental flaw:\n\n**The problem**: In database introspection, a unique constraint is typically reported with `unique=True` and `index=True` (since unique constraints are implemented as unique indexes). So filtering with `unique=False` would exclude the unique constraint, but the logic is incomplete.\n\nLooking at the `_constraint_names()` method signature and the filtering logic, the issue is that:\n1. When `index=True` is passed, it should match constraints where `infodict['index'] == True`\n2. When `unique=False` is passed, it should match constraints where `infodict['unique'] == False`\n3. But a unique constraint has BOTH `index=True` AND `unique=True`\n\nThe filter needs to explicitly exclude unique constraints when looking for p",

Then filter by type (index/unique/primary_key)\n\n### 3. **Inconsistent `.get()` usage**\nThe original code used `infodict['unique']` (direct access), but the patch used `infodict.get('unique', False)`.

The patch added `index=True, unique=False` parameters to `_constraint_names()` call in `_delete_composed_index()`, but this is **backwards logic**\n2. When deleting an `index_together`, we want to find and delete the **index constraint**, not filter it out\n3.
