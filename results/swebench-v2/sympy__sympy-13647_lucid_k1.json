      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis of Previous Patch\n\nThe previous patch changed:\n```python\nreturn self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n```\nto:\n```python\nreturn self[i, j - other.cols]\n```\n\n**What was wrong:** This fix was incomplete. While it removed the incorrect `pos` term, it didn't account for the fact that when `j >= pos + other.cols`, we need to access the original matrix columns that come AFTER the insertion point. The correct offset should be `j - other.cols`, but we need to map back to the original column index in `self`.\n\n## The Core Issue\n\nIn `_eval_col_insert`, when inserting columns at position `pos`:\n- Columns `0` to `pos-1` come from the original matrix (unchanged indices)\n- Columns `pos` to `pos+other.cols-1` come from the inserted matrix\n- Columns `pos+other.cols` onwards should come from the original matrix's columns starting at `pos`\n\nThe bug is in the third case. When `j >= pos + other.cols`, we're accessing co",
