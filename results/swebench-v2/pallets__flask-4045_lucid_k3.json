      "remediation": "Looking at the issue, previous patch, and test results, I can identify the problem:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**What was wrong with the previous patch:**\nThe patch used `assert` to validate the blueprint name, but `assert` statements can be disabled when Python runs with optimization flags (`-O` or `-OO`). This makes the validation unreliable in production environments.\n\n**Key insights from the test output:**\nThe tests are named:\n- `test_dotted_name_not_allowed` - expects an error when blueprint name contains dots\n- `test_route_decorator_custom_endpoint_with_dots` - likely tests that endpoint dots are still caught\n\nThe error count of 1 suggests the validation isn't working as expected, probably because:\n1. `assert` is not the right mechanism for runtime validation\n2. The error type/message may not match what the tests expect\n\n**What needs to change:**\n\n1. **Replace `assert` with a proper exception**: Use `ValueError` (consistent with Flask's error handling patterns) instead of `assert`\n\n2. **Provi",
