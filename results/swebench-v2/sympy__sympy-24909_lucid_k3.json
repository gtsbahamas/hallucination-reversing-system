This causes an error because the code tries to access `other.scale_factor` without first computing it.\n\n**The actual bug:**\nThe original code has this logic:\n```python\nfact = self.scale_factor * other.scale_factor\n\nif fact == 1:\n    return 1\n```\n\nThe problem is that when `other` is a `Quantity` (like `W` for watt), it has a `scale_factor` attribute. For base units like watt, `scale_factor = 1`. So when `milli` (scale_factor = 0.001) multiplies `W` (scale_factor = 1), we get:\n- `fact = 0.001 * 1 = 0.001`\n- But the code checks `if fact == 1` and returns `1` when true\n\nWait, that's not right.
