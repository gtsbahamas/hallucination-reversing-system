The current implementation appears to be working correctly according to the specification.\n\nHowever, let me verify if there might be any edge cases not covered by the tests:\n\n## Potential Issue (if any exists):\n\nThe implementation looks solid, but there's one subtle edge case that *might* be an issue depending on interpretation:\n\n**Edge case: \"I\" followed by punctuation (not space)**\n- Example: `\"I. You are wrong\"`\n- Current behavior: Would NOT count this as a boredom (requires \"I \" or exactly \"I\")\n- This seems correct based on the spec (\"starts with the word 'I'\")\n\n## Conclusion:\n\n**No fix needed.** The implementation correctly:\n1. Splits sentences by '.', '?', '!'\n2. Strips whitespace from each sentence\n3. Checks if sentence starts with the word \"I\" (either \"I \" or standalone \"I\")\n4. Counts and returns the number of boredoms\n\nThe logic handles all specified requirements and edge cases properly. All tests pass, and the implementation matches the specification.",
