      "remediation": "The current implementation is **already correct** and passes all tests. However, let me verify the logic:\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. **Skips the constant term** (starts at index 1)\n2. **Applies the power rule**: multiplies coefficient `xs[i]` by power `i`\n3. **Shifts indices down**: result position is implicitly `i-1` due to list comprehension\n4. **Handles edge cases**: empty list and single constant return `[]`\n\n## Verification with examples:\n\n**Example 1:** `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`\n- i=1: `1 * xs[1]` = `1 * 1` = 1\n- i=2: `2 * xs[2]` = `2 * 2` = 4\n- i=3: `3 * xs[3]` = `3 * 4` = 12\n- i=4: `4 * xs[4]` = `4 * 5` = 20\n- Result: `[1, 4, 12, 20]` \u2713\n\n**Example 2:** `[1, 2, 3]`\n- i=1: `1 * 2` = 2\n- i=2: `2 * 3` = 6\n- Result: `[2, 6]` \u2713\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**No fix needed.** The implementation is correct as-is. All test cases pass, and the logic properly implements the derivative of a polynomial using the power rule.",
