      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**Issue Identified:** The implementation actually passes all test cases and correctly implements the specification. However, there's a subtle logical issue that could cause problems in edge cases.\n\n**Problem:** The code includes 0 in the range, and 0 is divisible by both 11 and 13 (0 % 11 == 0 and 0 % 13 == 0). While 0 doesn't contain the digit 7, this is semantically questionable.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n**Line to change:** Line 3\n```python\nfor i in range(n):\n```\n\n**Change to:**\n```python\nfor i in range(1, n):\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- Starts iteration from 1 instead of 0\n- Avoids the edge case of checking if 0 is divisible by 11 or 13\n- More semantically correct: when counting numbers divisible by 11 or 13, we typically mean positive integers\n- Doesn't affect the test results (0 doesn't contain digit 7 anyway)\n- Makes the code more robust and clearer in intent\n\n**Alternative (if 0 should be included):** No change needed - the current implementation is correct.\n\nThe current implementation technically works for all given test cases, but starting from 1 is a cleaner approach that avoids the ambiguity of whether 0 should be considered.",
