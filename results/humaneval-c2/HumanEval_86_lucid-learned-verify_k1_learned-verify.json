      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n### Issue 1: Multiple consecutive spaces are lost\n**Problem:** `split(' ')` treats consecutive spaces as separate empty strings, but `join(' ')` always uses single spaces, losing the original spacing pattern.\n\n**Fix (lines 6-12):**\n- Replace the split/join approach with a character-by-character iteration\n- Track word boundaries manually while preserving all spaces\n- Build the result by sorting each word individually and keeping spaces in their original positions\n\n**Specific approach:**\n1. Iterate through the string character by character\n2. Accumulate characters into a current word\n3. When encountering a space, sort and append the current word, then append the space\n4. After the loop, handle any remaining word\n\n**Why this fixes it:** This preserves the exact spacing (including multiple consecutive spaces) while still sorting each word's characters.\n\n### Implementation strategy:\n```\nLines 6-12 should be replaced with:\n- Initialize result string and current_word string\n- Loop through each character in s\n  - If character is space: sort current_word, add to result, add space to result, reset current_word\n  - If character is not space: add to current_word\n- After loop: sort and add any remaining current_word to result\n```\n\nThis maintains all spacing exactly as in the input while sorting characters within each word.",
