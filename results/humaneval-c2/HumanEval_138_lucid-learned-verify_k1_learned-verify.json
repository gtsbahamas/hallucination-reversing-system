      "remediation": "The current implementation is **already correct** and passes all test cases. No fix is needed.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe implementation correctly identifies that a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers if and only if:\n1. `n \u2265 8` (minimum sum is 2+2+2+2 = 8)\n2. `n % 2 == 0` (sum of even numbers is always even)\n\nThe logic is sound:\n- For `n < 8`: Cannot be expressed (minimum is 8)\n- For `n \u2265 8` and even: Can always be expressed as `2 + 2 + 2 + (n-6)` where `(n-6)` is a positive even number\n- For odd `n`: Cannot be expressed (sum of evens is always even)\n\nAll test cases pass, confirming the implementation matches the specification.\n\n**Conclusion**: No changes required.",
