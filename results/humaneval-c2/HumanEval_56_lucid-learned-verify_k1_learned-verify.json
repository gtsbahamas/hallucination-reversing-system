The algorithm:\n1. Maintains a counter starting at 0\n2. Increments for each `<`\n3. Decrements for each `>`\n4. Returns False immediately if count goes negative (closing bracket without matching opening)\n5. Returns True only if count equals 0 at the end (all brackets matched)\n\n**No changes required.**",
