      "remediation": "The implementation is **already correct** and passes all test cases. No fixes are needed.\n\nThe logic is sound:\n1. **Counts even numbers** across both lists using `sum(1 for num in lst1 + lst2 if num % 2 == 0)`\n2. **Compares with lst1's length** to check if there are enough even numbers to fill lst1\n3. **Returns the correct answer** based on whether `even_count >= len(lst1)`\n\nThe approach correctly recognizes that:\n- We can exchange any elements between the lists\n- We need at least `len(lst1)` even numbers in total to make lst1 all-even\n- If we have enough even numbers in the combined pool, we can always arrange them into lst1\n\nBoth provided examples work correctly, and the logic handles all edge cases properly.\n\n**No changes required.**",
