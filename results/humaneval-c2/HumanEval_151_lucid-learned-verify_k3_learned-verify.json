However, let me verify the implementation against the specification more carefully.\n\nThe specification states: \"Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.\"\n\nThe current implementation has a subtle issue:\n\n## Issue Identified\n\nThe condition `num_int > 0` excludes zero, but **zero should be ignored anyway** since it's even (not odd). However, the real problem is that the specification says to ignore **negative** numbers, but the implementation uses `> 0` which means it's checking for **positive** numbers.\n\nWhile this works correctly for the given test cases, there's a logical inconsistency: the code should be checking `>= 0` (non-negative) rather than `> 0` (positive), since zero being excluded is a consequence of it being even, not negative.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line with condition `if num_int > 0 and num_int % 2 == 1:`\n\n**Change to:** `if num_int >= 0 and num_int % 2 == 1:`\n\n**Why this fixes it:**\n- Makes the logic clearer: we're checking for non-negative (not negative) as per spec\n- Zero is still correctly excluded because it fails the `num_int % 2 == 1` check (it's even)\n- More accurately reflects the specification's intent: \"ignore negative numbers\" means accept non-negative, not just positive\n- Functionally equivalent for the current test cases but more semantically correct\n\n**Note:** The current implementation actually works correctly for all test cases, so this is more of a semantic/clarity improvement rather than a bug fix. The behavior remains the same since zero is odd=False anyway.",
