      "remediation": "## Fix Plan\n\n**No changes needed** - the implementation is correct.\n\nThe current implementation properly handles bracket matching by:\n1. Using a counter to track the balance of opening vs closing brackets\n2. Incrementing for each `(` and decrementing for each `)`\n3. Returning `False` immediately if count goes negative (closing bracket without matching opening)\n4. Returning `True` only if the final count is 0 (all brackets matched)\n\nAll test cases pass, and the logic correctly implements the specification. The function handles both the case of unmatched opening brackets (count > 0 at end) and premature closing brackets (count < 0 during iteration).",
