All claims are marked as \"PASS\", including:\n- Case reversal for letters\n- Preserving non-letters\n- Reversing strings with no letters\n- All three examples\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**No changes needed.** The implementation is correct and handles all specified requirements:\n\n1. \u2705 Detects if string contains letters using `any(c.isalpha() for c in s)`\n2. \u2705 Reverses the entire string if no letters present\n3. \u2705 Reverses case for letters (lower\u2192upper, upper\u2192lower)\n4. \u2705 Preserves non-letter characters in place\n5. \u2705 All examples pass\n\nThe code is also well-structured and efficient. If there's a specific failing test case not shown in the results, please provide it for further investigation.",
