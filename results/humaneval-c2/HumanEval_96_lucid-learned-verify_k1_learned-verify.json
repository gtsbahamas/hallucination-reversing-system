      "remediation": "Looking at the test results, **all tests are passing**. The implementation is correct and handles all the specified cases properly.\n\nHowever, I notice a **discrepancy in the docstring** that could cause confusion:\n\n## Issue with Documentation\n\nThe docstring says: *\"returns an array of the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n\"*\n\nThis is misleading because:\n- It suggests returning \"the first n primes\" \n- But the actual behavior (and test cases) show it returns \"all primes less than n\"\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n**Line to change:** Line 2 (the docstring)\n\n**Current text:**\n```\n\"returns an array of the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n\"\n```\n\n**Should be:**\n```\n\"returns an array of all prime numbers less than n\"\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\n- The phrase \"first n integers that are prime\" incorrectly suggests we're limiting the count to n primes\n- The actual behavior returns ALL primes below n (not the first n primes)\n- For example, `count_up_to(20)` returns 8 primes (not 20 primes)\n- This clarification makes the docstring match the actual implementation and test cases\n\n**No code changes needed** - the implementation is correct, only the documentation needs updating.",
