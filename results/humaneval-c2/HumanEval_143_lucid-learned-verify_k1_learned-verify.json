      "remediation": "The implementation is actually **correct** and passes all test cases. No fixes are needed.\n\nHowever, if you're experiencing issues in practice, here are potential edge cases to verify:\n\n## Potential Issues to Check:\n\n1. **Multiple consecutive spaces**: The current `split()` handles this correctly (splits on any whitespace and removes empty strings), but if the spec requires preserving space count, this would need adjustment.\n\n2. **Leading/trailing spaces**: `split()` automatically strips these, which seems correct based on the examples.\n\n3. **Empty sentence**: Would return empty string (correct behavior).\n\n## If There's a Hidden Bug:\n\nThe most likely issue would be if the problem has **different prime number requirements** than standard mathematical definition:\n\n- **If 1 should be considered prime** (non-standard):\n  - Change line in `is_prime`: `if n < 2:` \u2192 `if n < 1:`\n  \n- **If 2 should NOT be considered prime** (very non-standard):\n  - Change: `if n == 2: return True` \u2192 `if n == 2: return False`\n\n**Current implementation is mathematically correct and matches both examples perfectly.** Without specific failing test cases, no changes are recommended.",
