      "remediation": "Based on the test results, **no fix is needed**. \n\n## Analysis\n\nAll test cases pass:\n- \u2705 Correctly counts minimum changes needed\n- \u2705 All three examples produce expected results\n- \u2705 Handles odd-length arrays (middle element correctly ignored)\n- \u2705 Handles even-length arrays (all pairs compared)\n- \u2705 Edge cases (empty/single-element arrays) work correctly\n\n## Why the implementation is correct\n\nThe algorithm compares elements from both ends moving toward the center:\n- For each mismatched pair `(arr[i], arr[n-1-i])`, exactly **1 change** is needed (change either element to match the other)\n- The loop runs `n // 2` times, which:\n  - Compares all necessary pairs\n  - Automatically excludes the middle element in odd-length arrays (which doesn't need comparison)\n- Returns the total count of mismatched pairs\n\n**Conclusion**: The current implementation is correct and complete.
