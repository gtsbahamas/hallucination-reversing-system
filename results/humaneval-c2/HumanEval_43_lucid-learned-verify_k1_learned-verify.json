All test cases pass correctly.\n\nThe implementation is working as intended:\n\n1. **Correct logic**: It uses a set to track seen numbers and checks if the negation exists before adding the current number\n2. **Handles distinct elements properly**: By checking `-num in seen` before `seen.add(num)`, it ensures the same position isn't used twice\n3. **Edge cases work**: Single elements return False, and `[0, 0]` correctly returns True (two distinct zeros at different positions)\n\nThe function correctly implements the specification with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.",
