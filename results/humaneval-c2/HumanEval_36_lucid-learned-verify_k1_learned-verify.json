Function should count digit 7 appearances\n2. Only in integers less than n\n3. Only in numbers divisible by 11 or 13\n4. Should return the correct count\n\n**Testing the examples:**\n\nExample 1: `fizz_buzz(50)` should return `0`\n- Numbers < 50 divisible by 11 or 13: 0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44\n- None contain digit 7\n- Expected: 0 \u2713\n\nExample 2: `fizz_buzz(78)` should return `2`\n- Numbers < 78 divisible by 11 or 13: 0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 55, 65, 66, 77\n- Numbers containing 7: 77 (contains two 7s)\n- Expected: 2 \u2713\n\nExample 3: `fizz_buzz(79)` should return `3`\n- Numbers < 79 divisible by 11 or 13: 0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 55, 65, 66, 77, 78\n- Numbers containing 7: 77 (two 7s), 78 (one 7)\n- Expected: 3 \u2713\n\n**Code Analysis:**\n- `range(n)` generates 0 to n-1, correctly handling \"less than n\"\n- `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0` correctly identifies divisibility\n- `str(i).count('7')` correctly counts occurrences of digit 7\n- Accumulates count correctly\n\n[{\"claim\": \"Counts the digit 7 in qualifying numbers\", \"verdict\": \"PASS\", \"reasoning\": \"str(i).count('7') correctly counts all occurrences of digit 7 in each number\"}, {\"claim\": \"Only considers integers less than n\", \"verdict\": \"PASS\", \"reasoning\": \"range(n) generates integers from 0 to n-1, which are all less than n\"}, {\"claim\": \"Only considers numbers divisible by 11 or 13\", \"verdict\": \"PASS\", \"reasoning\": \"The condition 'i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0' correctly filters for numbers divisible by 11 or 13\"}, {\"claim\": \"Returns correct count for fizz_buzz(50)\", \"verdict\": \"PASS\", \"reasoning\": \"Returns 0 as expected, since no qualifying numbers contain digit 7\"}, {\"claim\": \"Returns correct count for fizz_buzz(78)\", \"verdict\": \"PASS\", \"reasoning\": \"Returns 2 as expected, counting both 7s in 77\"}, {\"claim\": \"Returns correct count for fizz_buzz(79)\", \"verdict\": \"PASS\", \"reasoning\": \"Returns 3 as expected, counting two 7s in 77 and one 7 in 78\"}]",
      "remediation": "Based on the test results, **no fix is needed**. The implementation is correct and passes all test cases.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe current implementation correctly:\n1. \u2705 Iterates through integers less than n using `range(n)` (0 to n-1)\n2. \u2705 Filters for numbers divisible by 11 or 13 using `i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0`\n3. \u2705 Counts all occurrences of digit 7 in each qualifying number using `str(i).count('7')`\n4. \u2705 Accumulates the total count correctly\n5. \u2705 Passes all three provided test cases\n\n**Potential edge case consideration:** The code includes 0 in the range (which is divisible by both 11 and 13), but since 0 contains no digit 7, this doesn't affect the results.\n\n**Conclusion:** The implementation is correct as-is. No changes required.",
