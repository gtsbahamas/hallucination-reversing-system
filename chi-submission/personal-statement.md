# Personal Statement (150 words max)

## Ty Wells

I am an independent software engineer and researcher exploring the intersection of cognitive science and AI-assisted development. LUCID emerged from a practical frustration: while building production applications with AI coding assistants, I noticed that the hallucinations I was trained to distrust often contained surprisingly comprehensive specifications—capabilities my application *should* have but didn't. Rather than discarding these as errors, I built a system to extract, verify, and iteratively converge them into reality. The neuroscience parallel—that the brain itself constructs perception from its own "controlled hallucinations"—provided both the theoretical grounding and the system's name. I am particularly interested in how reframing AI hallucination from threat to cognitive resource changes developer behavior and metacognition. I plan to attend CHI 2026 in Barcelona in person.
